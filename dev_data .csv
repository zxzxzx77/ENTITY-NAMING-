" It has been proposed that the balance among E-proteins , Pax5 and Id proteins might have an important role in activated B cells [ 38 ] .",,,
" In that respect , E-proteins have been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of cell survival and growth at different points in lymphocyte development [ 40 ] .",,,
 The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP-6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B-lymphocyte progenitors by TGF-beta [ 40 ] .,upregulation;,14;,Positive_regulation;

 A GC-box located at position -87/-78 of the A3G promoter is important for transcriptional activity,,,
 The reporter studies shown in Figure 3 had demonstrated a drop in luciferase activity after deletion of the 30 nt at the 5' end of the 180 bp core promoter .,,,
 We therefore inspected the 30 bp sequence deleted in the 150 bp fragment and identified a GC-box at position -87/-78 ( see Figure 1 ) .,,,
" The sequence TGGGCGGGAC , which is interrupted in the 150 bp fragment , represents a variant of the (G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T) consensus motif recognized by Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors .",recognized;,22;,Binding;
" To analyze whether this putative Sp1/Sp3-binding site mediates transcriptional activity of the 180 bp core promoter , we introduced two point mutations which changed the sequence from TGGGCGGGAC to TGTTCGGGAC ( mutations shown in bold ) .",,,
" This resulted in a 71 % reduction of the transcriptional activity compared to the unmodified 180 bp promoter ( Figure 5A ) and this value was only marginally higher than the luciferase activity of the 150 bp fragment , indicating that the identified motif is essential for basal activity of the A3G core promoter .",,,
" To further examine the transcriptional potency of the 30 nt present in the 180 bp promoter , we cloned the region -114/-85 ( containing all nucleotides which are deleted in the 150 bp fragment , designated E1 ) or the region -92/-63 ( containing the putative Sp1/Sp3 motif , designated E2 ) into the vector pGL3-Promoter ( see Figure 1 ) .",,,
" This vector contains a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an SV40 promoter without enhancer sequences , and putative transcriptionally active sequences can be cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter .",,,
 Luciferase assays showed that the E1 element increased SV40 promoter activity only by approximately2-fold ( Figure 5B ) .,,,
" In contrast , the 30 nt of E2 enhanced the transcriptional activity of the SV40 promoter by approximately4.3-fold , indicating that the intact GC-box present in the E2 element was responsible for the strongly enhanced transcriptional activity of the SV40 promoter .",enhanced;responsible;enhanced;,9;31;35;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" To investigate whether the GC-box represents a binding site for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 , we performed EMSA analyses with nuclear extracts isolated from A3.01 T cells .",,,
" As probes , we radioactively labeled the unmodified E2 sequence ( nucleotides -92/-63 of the A3G promoter , probe designated APO-Sp1/3 ) or the same region carrying the two point mutations described above ( probe designated APO-Sp1/3mut ) .",,,
" As control , we used a commercially available Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide ( Sp1cons ) , which is known to be recognized by Sp1 transcription factors .",recognized;,21;,Binding;
 Four DNA-protein complexes were observed in the presence of the APO-Sp1/3 probe ( Figure 6A ) .,,,
" The upper two complexes were specific since they disappeared in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled APO-Sp1/3 probe ( Figure 6A , lane 7 ) .",,,
" Further confirmation of the specificity of these DNA-protein complexes was demonstrated by the inability of the unlabeled APO-Sp1/3mut probe to abolish binding ( Figure 6A , lanes 12 and 13 ) .",,,
" As expected , the two specific complexes were also present in the case of the Sp1 cons control probe ( Figure 6A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .",,,
" In contrast , none of these specific complexes was observed when the mutated probe was used ( Figure 6A , lanes 10 and 11 ) , confirming that protein binding was dependent on the identified GC-box .",,,
" In order to characterize the complexes , we performed supershift experiments using Sp1 - and Sp3 - specific antibodies .",,,
" The upper of the complexes that appeared in combination with the Sp1cons or APO-Sp1/3 probes , shifted in the presence of the Sp1 antibody ( Figure 6B , lanes 3 and 7 ) , whereas the lower complex shifted in the presence of the Sp3 antibody ( Figure 6B , lanes 4 and 8 ) .",,,
" Taken together , the EMSA demonstrated that the GC-box located on the A3G core promoter serves as a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3 .",,,
" To show binding of Sp1 and Sp3 factors also in the context of the endogenous A3G promoter , a chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay was performed .",binding;,3;,Binding;
" Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies , but not an actin antibody , immunoprecipitated the A3G promoter in A3.01 T cells ( Figure 6C , upper panel ) .",,,
" In contrast , no PCR signal was received with a primer pair recognizing a region in the A3G gene approximately4000 bp downstream of the Sp1/Sp3-binding site ( Figure 6C , lower panel ) .",,,

 This TSS is located 66 bp upstream of the start of the published mRNA sequence ( GenBanktrade NM021822 ) .,,,

" This is surprising , since IFN-alpha - inducible signaling cascades are present in A3.01 T cells : we showed that the control plasmid harboring interferon-responsive GAS elements was markedly induced by IFN-alpha treatment .",,,
" In contrast , the GAS element was not responsive to IFN-gamma treatment in these cells , suggesting that our T cell line was not able to mediate IFN-gamma - induced signals .",,,
" So far , enhanced A3G promoter activity by interferons is clearly described in hepatocytes and macrophages , whereas the situation in T cells is still unclear .",,,

" In conclusion , the current data suggests that regulation of the A3G promoter activity by interferons is dependent on the cell type and possibly also from the cellular activation status .",,,
 We additionally analyzed the influence of HIV-1 proteins on A3G promoter activity .,,,
 The HIV-1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways .,,,

" However , in contrast to previous observations in other cell types , PKD enzymes do not regulate basic cellular processes such as proliferation or survival responses , nor NFkappaB transcriptional activity downstream of the B cell antigen receptor .",,,
" Thus , PKDs have a selective role in DT40 B-cell biology .",,,
" The protein kinase D ( PKD ) serine/threonine kinase family has three members : PKD1 , PKD2 and PKD3 .",,,
" Most cell types express at least two PKD isoforms but PKD enzymes are especially highly expressed in haematopoietic cells , where they are activated in response to antigen receptors stimulation [ 2,3 ] .",,,
 A conserved signalling pathway linking antigen receptors to PKDs involves the activation of PLCgamma and the subsequent production of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) which stimulates classical and/or novel protein kinase Cs ( PKC ) that phosphorylate two key regulatory serine residues in the activation loop of PKD kinases [ 3-6 ] .,,,
 The N-terminal regulatory region of PKD enzymes contains a DAG binding domain and direct binding of DAG also contributes to PKD1 activation [ 7 ] as well as regulating the spatial location of PKD enzymes within cells [ 8-12 ] .,binding;binding;contributes;activation;,11;15;19;22;,Binding;Binding;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" In particular , PKDs have been widely linked to the activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor and in regulating cell survival during oxidative stress [ 17,21-23 ] .",,,

 Cellular proliferation and survival in DT40 B cells lacking expression of PKD family kinases,,,
 PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and survival ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) .,,,
 To investigate the effect that loss of PKD kinases had on B cell survival and/or proliferation we cultured wild-type and PKD-null cells in the presence ( PKD1 / 3 -/- : Flag - PKD3 +ve ) or absence ( PKD1 / 3 -/- ) of doxycycline and monitored exponential growth .,,,
 As shown in Fig .,,,
" 2A , PKD1 / 3 -/- cells proliferated exponentially and re-expression of Flag - PKD3 in these cells had no impact on the rate of proliferation .",re-expression;,11;,Gene_expression;
" Furthermore , the viability of PKD1 / 3 -/- B cells during routine culturing was not significantly different from that of wild-type B cells ( data not shown ) .",,,
 It was noted that the population doubling time of PKD1 / 3 -/- cells was slightly slower than that of wild type DT40 cells ( 12.7+/-2.8h versus 10.2+/-0.4h ) but the failure of PKD3 re-expression to modify the proliferation rate of PKD1 / 3 -/- cells suggests that these small differences were most likely the result of clonal variation and were not caused specifically by loss of PKD enzymes .,re-expression;,35;,Gene_expression;
" Thus , PKD family enzymes are not essential for regulating basal survival and proliferation of DT40 B cells .",,,
" PKD enzymes , specifically PKD1 and PKD2 , have previously been linked to a protective role against oxidative stress-induced injury in 3T3 fibroblast , HeLa and epithelial cell lines [ 17,30-32 ] .",,,
 We therefore addressed the role of PKD family kinases in regulating B cell survival in response to oxidative stress and other stress stimuli .,,,
 As shown in Fig .,,,
" 2B , loss of PKD1 / 3 expression had no significant impact on the survival of DT40 B cells in response to mitochondrial stress stimuli ( H2O2 or serum deprivation ) ; DNA damaging agents ( etoposide or doxorubicin ) ; ER pathway stress due to calcium overload ( thapsigargin ) or following prolonged treatment with phorbol esters or Trichostatin A , an inhibitor of class I/II HDACs .",loss;expression;,3;8;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Thus , PKD kinases do not play an essential role in regulating B cell survival in response to a range of different stress stimuli .",,,
 Antigen receptor regulated signalling pathways in PKD-null DT40 B cells,,,
 To further explore the contribution of PKD kinases to DT40 B cell biology we investigated whether specific BCR-regulated signalling events were defective in the PKD-null B cells .,,,
 Initial experiments revealed that surface expression of the BCR was reduced in PKD1 / 3 -/- ( and in PKD1 / 3 -/-:Flag - PKD3 +ve ) cells compared to wild-type DT40 B cells ( Fig. 3A and data not shown ) .,,,
" Nevertheless , BCR-crosslinking of PKD1 / 3 -/- cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades , similar to that observed in wild-type cells ( Fig. 3B ) .",,,
" Hence , BCR - induced activation of the Akt , mTOR / p70 S6 kinase ( as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation ) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1 / 3 - null B cells ( Fig. 3B ) .",induced;activation;phosphorylation;detectable;null;,5;6;23;31;37;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;Negative_regulation;Negative_regulation;
" Furthermore , enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1 / 3 - null B cells ( data not shown ) .",,,
 We did observe that the strength of BCR ( but not phorbol ester ) -induced regulation of the Erk1 - RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1 / 3 -/- B cells compared to wild-type B cells ( Fig. 3B ) .,,,
 One interpretation of this data is that PKD enzymes may modulate Erk activation .,,,
" Indeed , PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the growth factor-regulated Erk signalling in fibroblast and endothelial cell lines [ 33-35 ] .",,,
" However , BCR-induced Erk phosphorylation was also reduced in PKD1 / 3 -/ -- Flag - PKD3 + B cells ( data not shown ) suggesting that reduced BCR levels on the surface of PKD1 / 3 -/- ( and PKD1 / 3 -/ -- Flag - PKD3 + ) B cells may itself impact on the strength of activation of this specific intracellular signalling pathway .",,,
" To search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1 / 3 -/- DT40 B cells , we used a PKD substrate phospho-antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes ( LxRxxpS/T ) [ 36 ] .",,,
 As shown in Fig .,,,
" 3C , phorbol ester- and BCR-induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho-antibody was similar in wild-type and PKD1 / 3 -/- cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes .",,,
" However , pretreatment of both wild-type and PKD1 / 3 -/- DT40 B cells with GF109203X , a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS/T motifs .",,,
 Thus loss of PKD1 / 3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS/T motifs .,loss;,2;,Negative_regulation;
 This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS/T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine/threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2 .,,,
 However these experiments do provide further evidence that phosphospecific antisera are not sufficiently selective to be designated kinase specific substrate antisera .,,,
" BCR-induced signalling pathways culminate in the activation of gene transcription events that control B cell survival , proliferation and function .",,,
" In this context , it has been proposed that PKD family members control of gene transcription through activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor .",,,
" Thus , PKD-mediated activation of NFkappaB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals , including mROS/oxidative stress , lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr-Abl oncogene [ 17,21,23,30,37 ] .",,,
" Furthermore , expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1 - mediated NFkappaB activation [ 38 ] .",,,
" In B cells , NFkappaB is known to be regulated via DAG and PKCbeta [ 39,40 ] but whether PKDs are key intermediaries for NFkappaB regulation has not been explored .",,,
 The data ( Fig. 4A ) show that NFkappaB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild-type and PKD1 / 3 -/- DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation .,,,
" In contrast , BCR and phorbol ester-induced NFkappaB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKCbeta -/- DT40 B cells ( Fig. 4A ) , although strong activation of PKD kinases ( as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916 ) was observed in the PKCbeta -/- cells ( Fig. 4B ) .",autophosphorylation;observed;,34;41;,Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;
" Thus , PKD kinases are neither essential nor sufficient to mediate BCR-induced NFkappaB activation in DT40 B cells and hence do not participate in DAG/PKC mediated control of NFkappaB .",,,
 Protein kinase D serine kinases have been proposed to regulate diverse cellular functions including the phosphorylation and nuclear localisation of class II HDACs and the phosphorylation of HSP27 .,regulate;phosphorylation;phosphorylation;,10;16;26;,Regulation;Phosphorylation;Phosphorylation;
 It has also been suggested that PKDs act as mitochondrial sensors for oxidative stress and play a role in regulating NFkappaB transcription factors [ 41 ] .,,,
 Most of the data about the function of PKDs has come from experiments that ectopically express active or inhibitory PKD mutants or that use RNAi to reduce PKD expression .,,,
 We have used gene targeting to specifically delete PKD alleles in DT40 chicken B cells and can thus use PKD-null DT40 cells to assess the relative contribution of individual PKD isoforms in class II HDAC control versus oxidative stress responses and NFkappaB regulation in lymphocytes .,,,
" We have previously used these PKD-null DT40 cells to define an essential role for PKDs in regulation of class II HDACs , the present report now describes an indispensable role for PKDs in regulating the phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82 , a site previously identified as a target for the p38 - MAPKAPK2 signalling cascade [ 42 ] .",regulating;phosphorylation;target;,34;36;49;,Regulation;Phosphorylation;Regulation;
" However , studies of PKD-null DT40 cells reveal that PKD family kinases are not essential for oxidative stress survival responses nor are they required for activation of NFkappaB transcription factors .",,,
" These latter findings are in striking contrast to previous observations in HeLa and epithelial cell lines where overexpression/RNAi approaches have implicated PKD1 / 2 in the control of proliferation , survival and NFkappaB activation [ 20,23 ] .",,,
" Hence , the present report shows that the proposed roles for PKDs as key sensors that modulate survival pathways in response to oxidative stress and regulate cell survival and proliferation are not ubiquitous and may be restricted to certain cell lineages .",,,
" Taken together , these data indicate that loss of expression of PKD family members does not globally impact on early BCR-regulated signalling pathways .",,,

" Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti - IL-4 mAb complexes , the total number of CD4 + CD25 + T cell , as well as the Foxp3 + T cells diminished by half ( Figure S2G and S2H ) , confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4 + CD25 - cells , but a real decrease of CD4 + CD25 + T cells .",,,
" In conclusion , IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible Treg cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo .",,,

 The Role of TGF-beta in T Cell Differentiation,,,
" Although TGF-beta - reduced CD25 , IL-4 expression , and CD25 expression ( Figure 6B ) , IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-beta - mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3 + T cells , as shown by FACS analysis ( Figure 6A ) .",reduced;expression;expression;inhibited;induction;,4;8;12;20;24;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3 - cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3 + cells .,,,
" However , analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3 + over that of FOXP3 - .",,,
 In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation ( Figure 6A ) .,,,
" Furthermore the TGF-beta - mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25 - FOXP3 + minority , since the number of FOXP3 + cells was low/absent in the purified CD4 + CD45RA + T cells ( between 0 % and 1 % ) , and the FOXP3 + cells were not confined to the highly divided cells .",induction;expression;caused;,6;9;12;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

" The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-beta demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations ( day 2 ) , but transiently co-express both factors ( days 4-8 ) , before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process ( day 10 ; Figure 6C ) , suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3 .",demonstrated;co-express;repressing;,13;31;68;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;

 GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter,Represses;,2;,Negative_regulation;
" To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3 - mediated repression of human FOXP3 , the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered .",repression;,10;,Negative_regulation;
 The GATA-binding site is located 303 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( TSS ) [ 24 ] .,,,
" This site is highly conserved between humans , mice , and rats ( Figure S4 ) and may therefore play an important role in FOXP3 regulation .",regulation;,26;,Regulation;
 The functional relevance of this site was studied using a FOXP3 - promoter construct [ 24 ] .,,,
" We transfected human primary CD4 + T cells , in vitro differentiated Th2 cells , and Jurkat cells ( Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [ 25,26 ] ) , and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity .",express;,26;,Gene_expression;

" This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4 + CD45RO + T cells , whereas no difference was observed in naive ( GATA3 - ) CD4 + CD45RA + T cells , revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter ( Figure 8C ) .",repressor;,37;,Negative_regulation;
 Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay .,binds;,3;,Binding;
" HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector , and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site .",,,

" To gain insights into the in vivo situation , we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) using an anti - GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells , but not in iTreg cells ( Figure 7F ) .",binds;,28;,Binding;
 Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3 - binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression .,binding;repressing;expression;,10;16;18;,Binding;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" The current study reveals that FOXP3 induction , an important step in iTreg commitment , is inhibited by GATA3 , which is the key regulator for polarization toward Th2 cells .",induction;inhibited;,7;17;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;
" After differentiation , the effector Th2 cells become refractory to conversion into a FOXP3 + phenotype .",,,
" In accordance with other studies , we found that CD4 + CD25 - cells were able to up-regulate FOXP3 [ 12,27 ] .",up-regulate;,18;,Positive_regulation;
" Already-committed cells such as memory T cells and Th1 cells showed only moderate and transient FOXP3 induction , which is not sufficient to change the phenotype toward a regulatory T cell profile .",induction;,17;,Positive_regulation;
" In contrast , naive T cells could efficiently up-regulate FOXP3 when treated with TGF-beta to induce iTreg cells [ 10,28-34 ] , suggesting that FOXP3 plays an important role in the early differentiation process and may act in a way similar to that known for the Th1/Th2 decision factors T-bet and GATA3 .",up-regulate;,9;,Positive_regulation;
" This commitment is characterized by competitive expression of these factors [ 35,36 ] , which we also observed in differentiating FOXP3 + iTreg cells including a phase of co-expression , which turns into nonoverlapping expression upon completed differentiation .",expression;co-expression;expression;,7;29;35;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

" In contrast , differentiating naive T cells in the absence of polarization factors ( Th0 ) such as IL-4 , IL-12 , or TGF-beta showed only a transient FOXP3 expression and failed to generate a population of FOXP3 - expressing cells , but GATA3 and T-bet were up-regulated ( unpublished data ) .",absence;expression;expressing;up-regulated;,10;30;40;48;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" Interestingly , as we and others previously described , FOXP3 - promoting factors , such as dexamethasone [ 39 ] , CTLA-4 [ 40 ] , and estrogens [ 41 ] , are also known as inhibitors of GATA3 expression [ 42-45 ] .",promoting;inhibitors;expression;,12;37;40;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;

 The Th2 cytokine IL-4 but not IL-13 ( unpublished data ) was able to inhibit TGF-beta - mediated FOXP3 induction and therefore prevented conversion into the regulatory phenotype .,inhibit;induction;,15;20;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" To prove the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on inducible or natural Treg commitment in vivo , we treated mice with IL-4 and anti - IL-4 .",,,

 Only the IL-4 / IL-4 mAb complex resulted in a decrease of the amount of natural or inducible Treg ( CD25 + and Foxp3 + ) cells 7 d after treatment .,,,
 Our results suggest that IL-4 is only interfering with the differentiation of naive T cells into iTreg cells .,,,
" But since a distinction of nTreg and iTreg cells is currently not possible , because iTreg cells also transiently express CD25 after activation , we can not exclude that IL-4 may also inhibit Foxp3 expression in nTreg cells in vivo or that additional effects may contribute to the observed drop in Foxp3 expression .",express;inhibit;expression;contribute;drop;expression;,20;33;35;46;50;53;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;

" Similar effects have been recently described for IL-6 , which , combined with TGF-beta , inhibits the generation of iTreg cells and induces differentiation into the Th17 cells by an unknown mechanism [ 48,49 ] .",,,
 Thus the polarization into iTreg cells is negatively regulated by the effector cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 .,,,
 IL-4 has been previously shown to induce the generation of FOXP3 + Treg cells out of CD4 + CD25 - [ 50 ] .,,,
" In those experiments , the concentrations of IL-4 used were low , and as we also observed , IL-4 at low concentration slightly enhanced FOXP3 expression .",enhanced;expression;,24;26;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 IL-4 may favor proliferation of nTreg cells [ 47 ] or directly regulate FOXP3 expression in a STAT-dependent fashion [ 51 ] .,regulate;expression;,13;15;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
" Since IL-13 does not effectively reduce FOXP3 and fails to induce GATA3 , we hypothesized that the IL-4 - dependent inhibition of FOXP3 could be mediated by GATA3 .",reduce;induce;inhibition;mediated;,6;11;21;26;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 This result suggested a competitive mechanism between GATA3 and FOXP3 transcription factors in determining lineage commitment during the early phase of differentiation .,,,
" Accordingly , we investigated naturally high GATA3 - expressing cells and confirmed the absence of FOXP3 .",high;expressing;absence;,6;9;14;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
" Protein transduction of GATA3 into naive T cells inhibited FOXP3 induction in human , differentiating , naive T cells .",inhibited;induction;,9;11;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" Strikingly , the DO11.10: CD2 - GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3 + cells , which however displayed a 10 % -25 % lower frequency compared to wild-type DO11.10 mice .",,,
" Thus GATA3 restrains the development of certain Treg subsets , presumably the inducible , peripheral population and not those of thymic origin .",,,
" Thymic T cells undergo a different maturation process , which may explain the insensitivity of nTreg to GATA3 overexpression [ 52 ] .",overexpression;,19;,Positive_regulation;
" In contrast to the Th2-differentiating and iTreg-inhibiting function of GATA3 in peripheral T cells , GATA3 acts in the thymus together with other transcription factors such as the Repressor of GATA3 ( ROG ) in the differentiation process toward CD8 cells [ 53,54 ] or participates in complex transcriptional feedback network to regulate sympathoadrenal differentiation [ 55 ] .",,,
" Therefore , the role of GATA3 appears to be tissue specific and can not be generalized .",,,

 Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3 + iTreg cell generation .,expression;low;,4;5;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
" The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet , but the GATA-binding site is located adjacent to positive , inducing sites , composed of AP-1-NFATc2 sites [ 24 ] , and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP-1 / NFAT to the promoter ( unpublished observations ) .",inhibit;compete;binding;,7;38;41;,Negative_regulation;Negative_regulation;Binding;

" RUNX1 and RUNX3 also work together in the establishment of lineage specification of T lymphocytes ( Taniuchi et al. , 2002 ; Egawa et al. , 2007 ) .",,,
" RUNX1 is a frequent target for chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias ( Look , 1997 ) , and RUNX3 methylation and silencing is observed in various human epithelial cancers ( Blyth et al. , 2005 ) .",,,
" RUNX family members share the Runt domain , which is responsible for DNA binding ( Ito , 1999 ) .",,,
 The Runt domain-containing protein constitutes the alpha-chain partner of the heterodimeric CBF complex .,,,

 Involvement of adenylate cyclase and p70(S6)-kinase activation in IL-10 up-regulation in human monocytes by gp41 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .,Involvement;activation;up-regulation;,1;7;10;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in primary adult T-cell leukemia cells .,,,
 Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .,,,
" The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF-kappaB , which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV-I .",,,
" However , the HTLV-I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients .",expressed;,10;,Gene_expression;
" In this study , we examined the basis for NF-kappaB activation in freshly isolated leukemic cells from ATL patients .",,,
" We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients , like HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines , display constitutive NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of IkappaBalpha ( an inhibitor of NF-kappaB ) .",increased;degradation;,22;23;,Positive_regulation;Protein_catabolism;
" Whereas the NF-kappaB binding activity in Tax - expressing T-cell lines consisted mostly of p50 / c-Rel , fresh ATL samples contained p50 / p50 and p50 / p65 heterodimers .",,,

" Interestingly , the NF-kappaB in TL-Om1 consists of p50 / p50 and p50 / p65 like that in fresh primary leukemic cells .",,,

 Apoptosis-resistant T cells have a deficiency in NF-kappaB-mediated induction of Fas ligand transcription .,deficiency;induction;transcription;,6;9;13;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 Apoptosis induced through the TCR in CD4 + T cells is mostly mediated by the inducible expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) as a primary event leading to the commitment to death .,inducible;expression;,16;17;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" To gain a better understanding of the transcriptional events that regulate this expression , we took advantage of our previously described mutant Jurkat cells .",,,

 Here we show that both a FasL - and a consensus NF-kappaB- reporter construct are inefficiently induced in these cells compared to wild-type cells .,,,
" In addition , we demonstrate that the inducible transcriptional activity of the FasL reporter is abolished by specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation .",,,
" Thus , we could trace the deficit of the mutant cells to an inefficient NF-kappaB activation , evidencing a relevant role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of FasL expression in activated T cells .",role;regulation;expression;,21;26;29;,Regulation;Regulation;Gene_expression;

 NF-kappaB regulates Fas / APO-1 / CD95 - and TCR- mediated apoptosis of T lymphocytes .,,,
 The maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis by apoptosis is a critical regulatory mechanism in the normal immune system .,,,
" The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been shown to play a role in protecting cells against death mediated by TNF We show here that NF-kappaB also has a role in regulating Fas / APO-1 / CD95 - mediated death , a major pathway of peripheral T cell death .",,,
 Transfection of Jurkat cells with the NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 confers resistance against Fas - mediated apoptosis .,Transfection;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" Reciprocally , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the NF-kappaB inhibitor , IkappaB , makes the cells more susceptible to Fas - mediated apoptosis .",,,
" Furthermore , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor rendered a T cell hybridoma more susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis .",,,
" Correspondingly , transfection of p50 and p65 provided considerable protection from TCR-mediated apoptosis .",transfection;,3;,Gene_expression;
 These observations were corroborated by studies on Fas - mediated death in primary T cells .,,,
" Concanavalin A-activated cycling T cell blasts from mice that are transgenic for the dominant IkappaB molecule have increased sensitivity to Fas - mediated apoptosis , associated with a down-regulation of NF-kappaB complexes in the nucleus .",,,
" In addition , blocking TNF , itself a positive regulator of NF-kappaB , with neutralizing antibodies renders the cells more susceptible to anti - Fas - mediated apoptosis .",,,
" In summary , our results provide compelling evidence that NF-kappaB protects against Fas - mediated death and is likely to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance .",,,
 Evidence for distinct intracellular signaling pathways in CD34 + progenitor to dendritic cell differentiation from a human cell line model .,,,
 Intracellular signals that mediate differentiation of pluripotent hemopoietic progenitors to dendritic cells ( DC ) are largely undefined .,,,
 We have previously shown that protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA ) alone ) specifically induces differentiation of primary human CD34 + hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) to mature DC .,,,
 We now find that cytokine-driven ( granulocyte-macrophage CSF and TNF-alpha ) CD34 + HPC --> DC differentiation is preferentially blocked by inhibitors of PKC activation .,,,
 To further identify intracellular signals and downstream events important in CD34 + HPC --> DC differentiation we have characterized a human leukemic cell line model of this process .,,,
" The CD34 + myelomonocytic cell line KG1 differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-alpha , or PMA ( with or without the calcium ionophore ionomycin , or TNF-alpha ) , with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process .",,,
" Phenotypic DC characteristics of KG1 dendritic-like cells include morphology ( loosely adherent cells with long neurite processes ) , MHC I+/MHC IIbright / CD83 +/ CD86 +/ CD14 - surface Ag expression , and RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression .",expression;expression;,32;39;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Functional DC characteristics include fluid phase macromolecule uptake ( FITC-dextran ) and activation of resting T cells .,,,
" Comparison of KG1 to the PMA-unresponsive subline KG1a reveals differences in expression of TNF receptors 1 and 2 ; PKC isoforms alpha , beta I , beta II , and mu ; and RelB , suggesting that these components/pathways are important for DC differentiation .",expression;important;,12;41;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" Together , these findings demonstrate that cytokine or phorbol ester stimulation of KG1 is a model of human CD34 + HPC to DC differentiation and suggest that specific intracellular signaling pathways mediate specific events in DC lineage commitment .",,,
 IL-2 - mediated cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis does not require NF-kappa B or activating protein-1 activation in primary human T cells .,,,
 The IL-2 growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated T lymphocytes during a developing immune response .,,,
 IL-2 is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect Ag-activated T cells from programmed cell death .,,,
" In several cell types , activation of NF-kappa B and/or activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) has been demonstrated to be extremely important in blocking apoptosis .",,,
" To determine whether either or both of these transcription factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to IL-2 , primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation .",,,
 The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis .,induce;degradation;,10;15;,Positive_regulation;Protein_catabolism;
" Similarly , IL-2 neither activates JNK nor increases AP-1 binding activity to a consensus o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) response element .",,,
" On the other hand , the growth factor does induce the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 in these cells , as has been previously demonstrated .",induce;activation;,10;12;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 These data show that neither NF-kappa B nor AP-1 activation is required for IL-2 - mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T cells .,,,
 Impaired fetal thymocyte development after efficient adenovirus-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .,,,
 This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the NF-kappa B inhibitor I kappa B alpha ( mut-I kappa B ) and to study the maturation defects occurring when NF-kappa B activation is inhibited during fetal development .,express;,7;,Gene_expression;
" Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B were found to develop normally until the CD44 - CD25 + , CD4 - CD8- double-negative stage , while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased .",,,
" Proliferation , as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal , as did rearrangement and expression of the TCR beta-chain .",expression;,19;,Gene_expression;
" However , apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B than in FTOC infected with a control virus .",,,
" Taken together , these results suggest that NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of thymocytes in the early stages of their development .",,,
" Differential regulation of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 , two repressors of translation initiation , during human myeloid cell differentiation .",regulation;,2;,Regulation;
 Human myeloid differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation .,,,
" Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation , we have investigated translation initiation during human myeloid cell differentiation using the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U-937 monoblastic cell line .",,,
 A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway .,,,
" The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation , 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 .",regulation;,9;,Regulation;

 Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also observed when U-937 cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO .,,,
" In contrast , treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO , which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells , decreases 4E-BP1 amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount .",decreases;affecting;phosphorylation;increases;,24;28;30;33;,Negative_regulation;Regulation;Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;

" CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L - transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-a , and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB .",ligation;up-regulated;expression;secretion;,2;18;20;35;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Localization;

 Essential role of alveolar macrophages in intrapulmonary activation of NF-kappaB .,,,
 Acute inflammatory injury in rat lung induced by deposition of immunoglobulin G immune complexes requires expression of cytokines and chemokines as well as activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB .,,,
 There is little direct evidence regarding the role of alveolar macrophages in these activation events .,,,
" In the present studies , rat lungs were depleted of alveolar macrophages by airway instillation of liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate .",,,
" These procedures , which greatly reduced the number of retrievable alveolar macrophages , suppressed activation of lung NF-kappaB in the inflammatory model .",,,

 Neutrophil accumulation and development of lung injury were also substantially diminished .,,,
 Lung instillation of TNF-alpha in alveolar macrophage-depleted rats restored the NF-kappaB activation response in whole lung .,,,

 Role of cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors in NF-kappaB activation and lymphocyte transformation by herpesvirus Saimiri STP .,,,

" The STP-C488 P10 --> R mutant was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation , and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant .",,,

 Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .,,,

 High molecular weight dextran sulfate increases the activity of NF-kappaB-regulated promoter in monocyte-derived macrophages .,,,
 It is known that sulfated polysaccharides can mimic the action of common T-cell mitogens .,,,
" To investigate the molecular basis of the mitogenic effect of high molecular weight dextran sulfate ( HMDS ) , monocyte-derived macrophages were transfected with recombinant plasmid containing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) promoter , which is regulated by transcription factor NF-kappaB .",,,

 Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity in human T lymphocytes induces caspase-dependent apoptosis without detectable activation of caspase-1 and -3 .,,,
 NF-kappa B is involved in the transcriptional control of various genes that act as extrinsic and intrinsic survival factors for T cells .,,,
" Our findings show that suppression of NF-kappa B activity with cell-permeable SN50 peptide , which masks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kappa B1 dimers and prevents their nuclear localization , induces apoptosis in resting normal human PBL .",,,
" Inhibition of NF-kappa B resulted in the externalization of phosphatidylserine , induction of DNA breaks , and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis .",,,
" DNA fragmentation was efficiently blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and partially blocked by Ac-DEVD-fmk , suggesting that SN50-mediated apoptosis is caspase-dependent .",,,
" Interestingly , apoptosis induced by NF-kappa B suppression , in contrast to that induced by TPEN ( N,N,N',N'-tetrakis [2-pyridylmethyl]ethylenediamine ) or soluble Fas ligand ( CD95 ) , was observed in the absence of active death effector proteases caspase-1 - like ( IL-1 converting enzyme ) , caspase-3 - like ( CPP32 / Yama / apopain ) , and caspase-6 - like and without cleavage of caspase-3 substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor-45 .",,,

 Signaling events induced by lipopolysaccharide - activated toll-like receptor 2 .,activated;,7;,Positive_regulation;
 Human Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) is a signaling receptor that responds to LPS and activates NF-kappaB .,responds;,13;,Regulation;
" Here , we investigate further the events triggered by TLR2 in response to LPS .",,,
" We show that TLR2 associates with the high-affinity LPS binding protein membrane CD14 to serve as an LPS receptor complex , and that LPS treatment enhances the oligomerization of TLR2 .",associates;,5;,Binding;
" Concomitant with receptor oligomerization , the IL-1R-associated kinase ( IRAK ) is recruited to the TLR2 complex .",,,
" Intracellular deletion variants of TLR2 lacking C-terminal 13 or 141 aa fail to recruit IRAK , which is consistent with the inability of these mutants to transmit LPS cellular signaling .",recruit;,14;,Binding;
" Moreover , both deletion mutants could still form complexes with wild-type TLR2 and act in a dominant-negative ( DN ) fashion to block TLR2 - mediated signal transduction .",,,

 Activation of the Janus kinase 3 - STAT5a pathway after CD40 triggering of human monocytes but not of resting B cells .,,,
" CD40 / CD40 ligand interactions play a key role in the immune responses of B lymphocytes , monocytes , and dendritic cells .",interactions;,5;,Binding;
" The signal transduction events triggered by cross-linking of the CD40 receptor have been widely studied in B cell lines , but little is known about signaling following CD40 stimulation of monocytes and resting tonsillar B cells .",,,
" Therefore , we studied the CD40 pathway in highly purified human monocytes and resting B cells .",,,
" After CD40 triggering , a similar activation of the NF-kappaB ( but not of the AP-1 ) transcription factor complex occurred in both cell preparations .",,,
" However , the components of the NF-kappaB complexes were different in monocytes and B cells , because p50 is part of the NF-kappaB complex induced by CD40 triggering in both monocytes and B cells , whereas p65 was only induced in B cells .",induced;induced;,25;40;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" In contrast , although the Janus kinase 3 tyrosine kinase was associated with CD40 molecules in both monocytes and resting B cells , Janus kinase 3 phosphorylation induction was observed only in CD40 - activated monocytes , with subsequent induction of STAT5a DNA binding activity in the nucleus .",associated;phosphorylation;induction;induction;binding;,12;27;28;40;44;,Binding;Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Binding;
 These results suggest that the activation signals in human B cells and monocytes differ following CD40 stimulation .,,,

 Suppression of NF-kappaB activation in normal T cells by supernatant fluid from human renal cell carcinomas .,,,
" T lymphocytes from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) show reduced immune function and impaired activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappaB .",,,
 We determined the mechanism of NF-kappaB suppression in T cells of RCC patient and determined whether supernatant fluid from RCC explants ( RCC-S ) induced the same phenotype of NF-kappaB suppression in normal T cells that is observed in patient T cells .,,,
 The pattern of kappaB-binding activity in T cells of RCC patient was altered as compared to that seen in T cells obtained from normal volunteers .,,,
" In some patients , no activation of RelA / NFkappaB1 - binding activity was detectable , while in others kappaB-binding activity was modestly induced but the duration was reduced .",activation;binding;,6;12;,Positive_regulation;Binding;

 These results show that RCC-S can induce in normal T cells the same phenotype of impaired NF-kappaB activation that is detected in T cells of RCC patient .,,,

 Monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies from a patient with Takayasu arteritis activate endothelial cells from large vessels .,,,
" OBJECTIVE : To create monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies ( mAECA ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation .",,,
" METHODS : A panel of mAECA was generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with Takayasu arteritis , using Epstein-Barr virus transformation .",,,
 Activity against macrovascular EC ( HUVEC ) and microvascular EC ( human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 ) antigens was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .,,,
 Inhibition studies were used to select the monoclonal antibodies ( mAECA ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the total IgG - AECA from the Takayasu arteritis patient .,,,
 The binding of the mAECA to human aortic EC was studied by immunohistochemistry .,,,

" All mAECA possessed high activity against macrovascular EC , but none had significant antimicrovascular EC activity .",,,
" The mAECA , but not normal human IgG , had anti-human aortic EC activity .",,,
" Four of the 6 mAECA activated EC , manifested by increased IL-6 and vWF secretion .",increased;secretion;,11;15;,Positive_regulation;Localization;
 The 4 mAECA induced EC expression of adhesion molecules and increased adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to EC .,,,
" In addition , these mAECA stimulated the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .",,,
" CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that AECA may directly stimulate EC in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of adhesion molecule expression associated with NF-kappaB activation and adhesion of monocytes , and may therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis .",,,
 The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins TRADD and receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) but does not induce apoptosis or require RIP for NF-kappaB activation .,engages;,9;,Binding;
 A site in the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) -associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation .,associates;,15;,Binding;
 We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from TNFR1 signaling through TRADD .,,,
" LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation , while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues .",,,
" Further , LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation , while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302 .",,,
 LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293 .,,,
" Unlike TNFR1 , LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines .",interact;associates;,6;16;,Binding;Binding;
" Surprisingly , LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-kappaB activation .",,,
" Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP , LMP1 does not induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells .",association;,3;,Binding;
" These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1 , TRADD , and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth .",,,
 Regulatory effects of interleukin-11 during acute lung inflammatory injury .,,,

 IL-11 mRNA and protein were both up-regulated during the course of this inflammatory response .,up-regulated;,7;,Positive_regulation;
" Exogenously administered IL-11 substantially reduced , in a dose-dependent manner , the intrapulmonary accumulation of neutrophils and the lung vascular leak of albumin .",,,
" These in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of IL-11 were associated with reduced NF-kappaB activation in lung , reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids , and diminished up-regulation of lung vascular ICAM-1 .",diminished;up-regulation;,36;37;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 ETS transcription factors regulate an enhancer activity in the third intron of TNF-alpha .,regulate;,4;,Regulation;

 A reporter construct containing the 5'-flanking region of the mouse TNF-alpha gene displayed weak activity when transfected into RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells .,activity;when;,15;16;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 The addition of the third intron of TNF-alpha to this construct resulted in an enhancement of CAT protein .,,,

 Abnormal NF-kappa B activity in T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with decreased p65 - RelA protein expression .,,,
" Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , including surface Ag receptor-initiated signaling events and lymphokine production .",,,
" Because NF-kappa B contributes to the transcription of numerous inflammatory genes and has been shown to be a molecular target of antiinflammatory drugs , we sought to characterize the functional role of the NF-kappa B protein complex in lupus T cells .",,,
" Freshly isolated T cells from lupus patients , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the TCR with anti-CD3 and anti - CD28 Abs to assess proximal membrane signaling , and with PMA and a calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events .",,,
 We measured the NF-kappa B binding activity in nuclear extracts by gel shift analysis .,,,
" When compared with normal cells , the activation of NF-kappa B activity in SLE patients was significantly decreased in SLE , but not in RA , patients .",,,
" NF-kappa B binding activity was absent in several SLE patients who were not receiving any medication , including corticosteroids .",,,
" Also , NF-kappa B activity remained absent in follow-up studies .",,,
" In supershift experiments using specific Abs , we showed that , in the group of SLE patients who displayed undetectable NF-kappa B activity , p65 complexes were not formed .",,,
" Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed decreased or absent p65 protein levels .",,,
" As p65 complexes are transcriptionally active in comparison to the p50 homodimer , this novel finding may provide insight on the origin of abnormal cytokine or other gene transcription in SLE patients .",,,
 Possible differences in the mechanism(s) of action of different glucocorticoid hormone compounds .,,,
 Different glucocorticoid hormones ( GCH ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity .,,,
" The mechanism(s) of action of GCH is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway .",,,
" We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DXM ) on the production of cytokines ( IL-2 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , IL-10 ) by peripheral T lymphocytes , and the effects on the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity by activated Jurkat cell line .",effects;production;effects;,5;24;43;,Regulation;Gene_expression;Regulation;
" The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) not all the cytokines investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three GCH and ( b ) DXM inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN .",,,
" These data are in agreement with the concept that different GCH compounds might differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with transcription factor .",,,
 The p53 paradox in the pathogenesis of tumor progression .,,,
" Recent evidence suggests that the p53 molecule appears in two different forms : the mutant p53 that stimulates tumor progression , and wild type p53 that inhibits tumor progression .",,,
" In addition , it has been established that tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) can activate the expression of wild type p53 in concert with the nuclear transcription factor , NF-kappa B .",activate;expression;,16;18;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Both TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B are also involved in the stimulation of the pathway that leads to the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules and , hence , antigen presentation to the T cells .",,,
 In this paper we shall advance the hypothesis that : ( i ) TNF-alpha indirectly controls immune surveillance ; and ( ii ) TNF-alpha controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of wild type p53 .,regulation;,33;,Regulation;
" Thus , it is hypothesized that elevated TNF-alpha is primarily responsible for promoting tumor progression .",elevated;,7;,Positive_regulation;
 Differential effects of lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor on monocytic IkappaB kinase signalsome activation and IkappaB proteolysis .,,,
 The inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) are potent activators of NF-kappaB .,,,
" This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) signalsome activation and IkappaB phosphorylation/proteolysis in human monocytic cells and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-alpha , IKK-beta , NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , IKK-gamma ( NF-kappaB essential modulator ) , and IKK complex-associated protein .",,,
" Kinase assays showed that TNF elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK-alpha than on IKK-beta , peaking at 5 min .",effect;,19;,Regulation;

" Furthermore , our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK , IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells .",association;,6;,Binding;

 Activation of protein kinase C and elevation of cAMP interact synergistically to raise c-Fos and AP-1 activity in Jurkat cells .,,,
 We have earlier found that in Jurkat cells activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) enhances the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation induced by adenosine receptor stimulation or activation of Gs .,,,
" Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) which stimulates PKC and a combination of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA ( 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido adenosine ) and forskolin to raise cAMP , on the levels of c-Fos and Jun and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the transcription factor , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .",effect;stimulates;levels;,7;19;42;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the PKC stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents .,,,

 Functional interaction between the two zinc finger domains of the v-erb A oncoprotein .,,,
 The v-erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor .,,,
 The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor .,,,
" The v-erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA-binding domain relative to that of c-erb A , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for v-erb A function in the neoplastic cell .",important;,34;,Regulation;
" We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c-erb A can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a v-erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61 .",role;,22;,Regulation;
" Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein , a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations , and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61 .",,,

 Inhibition of transcription factors belonging to the rel/NF-kappa B family by a transdominant negative mutant .,,,
" The KBF1 factor , which binds to the enhancer A located in the promoter of the mouse MHC class I gene H-2Kb , is indistinguishable from the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B , which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .",binds;,6;,Binding;
" The KBF1 / p50 factor binds as a homodimer but can also form heterodimers with the products of other members of the same family , like the c-rel and v-rel (proto)oncogenes .",,,
 The dimerization domain of KBF1 / p50 is contained between amino acids 201 and 367 .,,,
" A mutant of KBF1 / p50 ( delta SP ) , unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers , has been constructed .",bind;heterodimers;,14;23;,Binding;Binding;
" This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of wild-type proteins of the same family ( KBF1 / p50 , c- and v-rel ) .",binding;,10;,Binding;
 This mutant also functions in vivo as a trans-acting dominant negative regulator : the transcriptional inducibility of the HIV long terminal repeat ( which contains two potential NF-kappa B binding sites ) by phorbol ester ( PMA ) is inhibited when it is co-transfected into CD4 + T cells with the delta SP mutant .,,,
 Similarly the basal as well as TNF or IL1-induced activity of the MHC class I H-2Kb promoter can be inhibited by this mutant in two different cell lines .,,,
 These results constitute the first formal demonstration that these genes are regulated by members of the rel/NF-kappa B family .,,,

 Anti - CD2 receptor antibodies activate the HIV long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes .,,,
" The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation , two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection .",,,
 Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti - CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures .,,,
 In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti - CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production .,,,
 We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti - CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat .,,,
" Furthermore , CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat - CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer .",,,

 cAMP-dependent regulation of proenkephalin by JunD and JunB : positive and negative effects of AP-1 proteins .,,,
" We demonstrate that JunD , a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex , activates transcription of the human proenkephalin gene in a fashion that is completely dependent upon the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase A .",,,
" Activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD is dependent upon a previously characterized cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca(2+)-inducible enhancer , and JunD is shown to bind the enhancer as a homodimer .",bind;,27;,Binding;

 Induction of monocytic differentiation and NF-kappa B-like activities by human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection of myelomonoblastic cells .,,,
 The effects of human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection on cellular differentiation and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity have been investigated in a new model of myeloid differentiation .,,,
 PLB-985 cells represent a bipotential myelomonoblastic cell population capable of either granulocytic or monocytic differentiation after induction with appropriate inducers .,,,
" By virtue of the presence of CD4 on the cell surface , PLB-985 cells were chronically infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB .",,,

 Epstein-Barr virus replicative gene transcription during de novo infection of human thymocytes : simultaneous early expression of BZLF-1 and its repressor RAZ .,expression;,16;,Gene_expression;
 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is known to infect B cells and epithelial cells .,,,
 We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes .,,,
 Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection .,,,

 Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .,,,
 A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .,,,

 Modulation of endogenous IL-1 beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist results in opposing effects on HIV expression in chronically infected monocytic cells .,,,
 A proportion of HIV-infected individuals experience episodes of localized or systemic bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria .,,,
" Many of the clinical side effects of these infections are associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines , which are induced primarily by LPS , a constituent of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria .",,,

 Transcriptional regulation of the interleukin-2 gene in normal human peripheral blood T cells .,,,
 Convergence of costimulatory signals and differences from transformed T cells .,,,
" To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells , we have optimized conditions for transient transfection .",,,
 Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter-reporter gene behavior closely parallels the endogenous gene in response to T cell receptor and costimulatory signals .,,,
" As assessed with mutagenized promoters , the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF- kappaB site .",,,
" Both primary activation , with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3 , and costimulation , provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7-positive ( B cells ) or B7-negative ( endothelial ) accessory cells , are mediated through the same cis-elements .",,,
" Interestingly , the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells .",,,
 We conclude that IL-2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis-elements in the IL-2 promoter .,,,
 A hydrophobic domain of Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand modulates calcium influx signaling in T lymphocytes .,,,

" Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes , being specific to T cells , dependent on their activation , and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) .",,,
" DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site , META(P) , and a promoter-distal site , META(D+) , within the 400-base pair META region .",,,

 This catalytic event is rate limiting in remodeling of tissues rich in fibrillar collagen such as the skin and lungs .,,,
" The regulation of collagenase expression is cell-type specific ; bacterial LPS and zymosan , a yeast cell wall derivative , are potent inducers of collagenase expression in macrophages , but do not alter fibroblast collagenase expression .",,,
" Since promoter elements controlling collagenase transcription in monocytic cells have not been previously defined , we sought to delineate responsive cis-acting elements of the collagenase promoter in transiently transfected human ( U937 ) and murine ( J774 ) monocytic cell lines .",,,
" Deletion constructs containing as little as 72 bp of 5' -flanking sequence of the collagenase promoter were sufficient for LPS- or zymosan-mediated transcriptional induction , whereas phorbol inducibility exhibited an absolute requirement for upstream elements including the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site ( -83 to -91 ) and TTCA sequence ( -102 to -105 ) in both monocytic cells and fibroblasts .",,,
" Mutagenesis of the activator protein-1 [ AP-1 ] site at -72 abolished basal promoter activity and LPS/zymosan inducibility , while mutagenesis of an NF-kappaB-like site at -20 to -10 had no effect .",,,
" Nuclear extracts from LPS- and zymosan-treated cells showed strong AP-1 activity by gel-shift analysis , and supershift analysis showed the AP-1 complexes contained specific members of both the jun and fos gene families .",,,
" These data indicate that , in contrast to most LPS effects , AP-1 , but not nuclear factor-kappaB , mediates LPS induction of collagenase transcription in macrophagelike cells .",,,
" Furthermore , as compared to regulation by phorbol ester , collagenase induction in monocytic cells by cell wall derivatives of bacteria or yeast is largely independent of upstream promoter sequences .",,,

 IL-10 inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in CD3-stimulated human peripheral T lymphocytes .,,,
 IL-10 markedly reduces nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B/Rel nuclear activity induced in PBMC by stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 .,,,
" The inhibition is exerted specifically on the NF-kappa B/Rel activation induced by mAb OKT3 , and not that produced by PMA .",,,

 Soluble factors do not appear to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition .,,,
" On the other hand , the up-regulation of CD80 Ag , found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3 , is not detected after addition of IL-10 , and the anti - CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10 - inhibited lymphocytes .",up-regulation;detected;,7;24;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 The involvement of p21(ras) in the regulation of calcium-dependent signals has been suggested through analysis of its role in the activation of NF-AT .,,,

 The class II trans- activator ( CIITA ) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of MHC class II proteins .,,,
 Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain .,,,
" Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three alpha-helices , each with a high proportion of acidic residues .",,,

 TNFalpha cooperates with the protein kinase A pathway to synergistically increase HIV-1 LTR transcription via downstream TRE-like cAMP response elements .,,,

" These downstream sequence elements , termed DSE , can bind both AP-1 and CREB/ATF transcription factors .",,,
" Recently , we demonstrated that the DSE are also cAMP-responsive elements ( CRE ) , since they mediated activation signals elicited by cholera toxin ( Ctx ) , a potent activator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) signal transduction pathway .",,,
" In the present study , we demonstrate that the HIV-1 DSE can mediate the transcriptional synergy elicited by the combination of Ctx and TNFalpha .",,,

" Transfection studies of LTR reporter constructs indicated that mutation of the DSE sites abrogated the LTR-mediated synergy induced by Ctx and TNFalpha , whereas the synergy induced by Ctx and IL-1beta was unaffected , suggesting TNFalpha and IL-1beta cooperate differently with the cAMP/PKA activation pathway to induce HIV-1 expression in U1 cells .",,,
" Because the DSE are also TRE sites , we assessed the effect of the agonist combinations on AP-1-dependent transcription .",,,
 TNFalpha as well as IL-1beta cooperated with Ctx to produce a synergistic activation of AP-1-mediated transcription .,,,
 These data indicate that the TRE-like cAMP-responsive DSE sites within the 5'-untranslated leader can mediate the transcriptional cooperativity between TNFalpha and the cAMP/PKA pathway .,,,

 We examined the allele-specific expression of WT1 in cultured human fibroblasts from 15 individuals .,,,

 Exclusive paternal expression of WT1 was also shown in non-cultured peripheral lymphocytes from the latter two individuals .,,,

" Our unexpected observations of paternal or biallelic expression of WT1 in fibroblasts and lymphocytes , together with the previous findings of maternal or biallelic expression in placentae and brains , suggest that the allele-specific regulatory system of WT1 is unique and may be controlled by a putative tissue- and individual-specific modifier .",expression;expression;controlled;,8;25;44;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Regulation;
 Extinction of immunoglobulin gene expression in B cells upon fusion with HeLa cells is preceded by rapid nuclear depletion of essential transcription factors and is accompanied by widespread inactivation of genes expressed in a B cell-specific manner .,,,
" When immunoglobulin ( Ig ) expressing B cells are fused with non-B cells , Ig expression is rapidly suppressed at the level of transcription , a phenomenon termed extinction .",,,
 Here we demonstrate that fusion of HeLa cells with either diploid or tetraploid B cells ( Daudi ) results in widespread extinction of several other B cell-encoded genes that are expressed in a B cell-specific manner .,,,
" In contrast , expression of B cell-expressed genes that are not dependent on cell-specific controls is unaffected .",,,
" We show that the molecular mechanism(s) underlying Ig gene extinction can be explained , at least in part , by a lack of transcription factors that are essential for Ig gene transcription .",,,
" These transcription factors are either not produced due to block of transcription of their respective genes ( Oct-2 , OBF-1 , PU.1 ) , or are rendered inactive posttranslationally ( NF-kappa B , E47 ) .",transcription;block;transcription;inactive;,2;10;12;28;,Transcription;Negative_regulation;Transcription;Negative_regulation;
" By isolating Daudi x HeLa heterokaryons a few hours after fusion , we have studied the initial fate of two B cell-specific transcription factors involved in Ig gene transcription , Oct-2 and NF-kappa B .",,,
" This report provides the first demonstration that upon fusion with HeLa cells , the nuclear contents of B cell-expressed transcription factors are depleted within a few hours with kinetics that are as fast or faster than that of Ig gene extinction .",,,
" Thus , the extinguishing mechanism is effective very early after fusion .",,,
 We suggest that extinction of Ig genes is part of a global mechanism that suppresses the differentiation program foreign to the HeLa phenotype .,,,
 Regulation of Id3 cell cycle function by Cdk-2 - dependent phosphorylation .,Regulation;dependent;phosphorylation;,1;10;11;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;
 The functions of basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors in activating differentiation-linked gene expression and in inducing G1 cell cycle arrest are negatively regulated by members of the Id family of HLH proteins .,,,
" These bHLH antagonists are induced during a mitogenic signalling response , and they function by sequestering their bHLH targets in inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind to specific gene regulatory ( E box ) sequences .",,,
" Recently , cyclin E - Cdk2 - and cyclin A - Cdk2 - dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue ( Ser5 ) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle , and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro ( E.Hara , M.Hall , and G.Peters , EMBO J.16:332-342 , 1997 ) .",dependent;phosphorylation;,14;15;,Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;
 We now show that an analogous cell-cycle - regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent reporter gene function in vivo .,regulated;phosphorylation;,9;10;,Regulation;Phosphorylation;
" Furthermore , compared with wild-type Id3 , an Id3 Asp5 mutant ( mimicking phosphorylation ) is unable to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts , whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant ( ablating phosphorylation ) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein .",,,
 Cdk2 - dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1-to-S phase that both nullifies an early G1 cell cycle regulatory function of Id3 and modulates its target bHLH specificity .,,,
 These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote cell cycle S phase entry is not simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer-dependent gene expression and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation .,,,
 Cytokine rescue from glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in T cells is mediated through inhibition of IkappaBalpha .,inhibition;,13;,Negative_regulation;
" We previously reported that dexamethasone ( DEX ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid , causes apoptosis in mature Th cell lines , and that this induction of cell death is prevented by specific cytokines , namely , by IL-2 in Th1 cells and by IL-4 in Th2 cells .",,,

" Xenogeneic human serum promotes leukocyte adhesion to porcine endothelium under flow conditions , possibly through the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B .",,,
 Endothelial cell activation and leukocyte infiltration are a consistent feature of discordant xenograft rejection .,,,
" Here we evaluated whether xenogeneic serum , as a source of xenoreactive natural antibodies and complement , induced endothelial cell activation with consequent leukocyte adhesion under flow conditions .",,,
 Porcine aortic endothelial cells ( PAEC ) were incubated for 1 hr 30 min or 5 hr with 10 % homologous porcine serum ( control ) or 10 % xenogeneic human serum and then perfused with total human leukocytes in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1.5 dynes/cm2 ) .,,,
 Adherent cells were counted by digital image analysis .,,,
 Xenogeneic human serum significantly ( P < 0.01 ) increased the number of adherent leukocytes as compared with porcine serum .,,,
" A similar adhesive response was elicited by TNF alpha ( 100 U/ml ) , one of the most potent inducers of endothelial cell adhesive properties , here used as positive control .",,,
" In order to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying endothelial cell activation by xenogeneic serum , we focussed on transcription factor NF-kappa B , a central regulator for the induction of different genes , including adhesive molecules and chemoattractants .",,,
" By confocal fluorescence microscopy , we observed a positive staining for NF-kappa B ( p65 subunit ) in the nuclei of PAEC exposed for 1 hr 30 min to human serum , which indicated NF-kappa B activation in this setting .",,,
" At variance , in PAEC incubated with the homologous serum , NF-kappa B was strictly localized in the cell cytoplasm .",,,
" Treatment of PAEC exposed to xenogeneic serum with the NF-kappa B inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( PDTC , 25 microM ) and tosyl-phechloromethylketone ( TPCK , 25 microM ) significantly ( P < 0.01 ) reduced leukocyte adhesion in respect to PAEC treated with human serum alone .",,,
 Findings that xenogeneic serum promotes leukocyte-endothelium interaction possibly through NF-kappa B activation might be relevant for designing future therapeutic strategies aimed at prolonging xenograft survival .,,,

 NF-kappaB only partially mediates Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 activation of B cells .,,,
 The latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is required for EBV-induced immortalization of human B cells and causes tumorigenic transformation of cell lines .,,,

" A nongenomic mechanism for progesterone-mediated immunosuppression : inhibition of K+ channels , Ca2+ signaling , and gene expression in T lymphocytes .",,,
 The mechanism by which progesterone causes localized suppression of the immune response during pregnancy has remained elusive .,,,
" Using human T lymphocytes and T cell lines , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks voltage-gated and calcium-activated K+ channels ( KV and KCa , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential .",,,
" As a result , Ca2+ signaling and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) -driven gene expression are inhibited .",,,
" Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated signal transduction , since it blocks sustained Ca2+ signals after thapsigargin stimulation , as well as oscillatory Ca2+ signals , but not the Ca2+ transient after TCR stimulation .",,,
" K+ channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or no effect , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked KV and KCa channels .",,,
" Progesterone effectively blocked a broad spectrum of K+ channels , reducing both Kv1.3 and charybdotoxin-resistant components of KV current and KCa current in T cells , as well as blocking several cloned KV channels expressed in cell lines .",reducing;,11;,Negative_regulation;

" Qualitatively different effects were observed for the IL-1-induced activation of stress-activated protein ( SAP ) kinases : permanent overexpression of IRAK did not affect the dose dependence but prolonged the kinetics of IL-1-induced activation of SAP kinases , suggesting that this signaling branch may be regulated by distinct mechanisms .",,,
 Decreased IL-12 production and Th1 cell development by acetyl salicylic acid-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB .,,,
 IL-12 is a 75-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of two covalently linked p35 and p40 chains .,,,
 This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a prominent role in the development of Th1 cell-mediated immune responses .,,,
 Th1 cell-mediated immune responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases .,,,
" Thus , IL-12 appears to be a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory conditions .",,,
" In this study , we investigated the effects of a commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory drug , acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) , on IL-12 production and Th1 cell development .",,,
 ASA was found to inhibit secretion of the IL-12 heterodimer as well as p40 monomer by human monocytic cells .,inhibit;secretion;,5;6;,Negative_regulation;Localization;
 This was associated with the down-regulation of IL-12p40 mRNA expression .,down-regulation;,6;,Negative_regulation;
" Analysis of the regulation of the p40 gene promoter revealed that ASA inhibited NF-kappaB activation and binding to the p40 - kappaB site in the p40 promoter , leading to transcriptional repression of the p40 gene .",regulation;,4;,Regulation;
" Addition of ASA to an in vitro T helper cell differentiation system , at concentrations compatible with plasma levels reached during anti-inflammatory therapy , resulted in reduced development of Th1 cells .",,,
 These results suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by ASA leads to down-regulation of IL-12 production and inhibition of Th1 cell development .,,,
 Membrane-associated lymphotoxin on natural killer cells activates endothelial cells via an NF-kappaB-dependent pathway .,,,
 BACKGROUND : Inhibition of complement in small animal models of xenotransplantation has demonstrated graft infiltration with natural killer ( NK ) cells and monocytes associated with endothelial cell ( EC ) activation .,,,
" We have previously demonstrated that human NK cells activate porcine EC in vitro , which results in adhesion molecule expression and cytokine secretion .",,,
" In this study , we used the NK cell line NK92 to define the molecular and cellular basis of NK cell-mediated EC activation .",,,
 METHODS : EC were transfected with either reporter constructs containing the luciferase gene driven either by E-selectin or interleukin ( IL ) -8 promoters or a synthetic NF-kappaB-dependent promoter .,,,
" In addition , a dominant-negative mutant tumor necrosis factor receptor I ( TNFRI ) expression vector was co-transfected in inhibition studies .",co-transfected;,18;,Positive_regulation;
" Forty-eight hours after transfection , EC were stimulated with NK cells or NK cell membrane extracts for 7 hr and activation was measured by a luciferase assay .",,,
" RESULTS : Co-culture of NK cells with transfected EC enhanced E-selectin , IL-8 , and NF-kappaB-dependent promoter activity .",,,
 NK cell membrane extracts retained the capacity to activate EC and induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB ( p50 and p65 ) .,induced;translocation;,12;14;,Positive_regulation;Localization;
 Western blotting of NK cell and membrane extracts detected the presence of Lymphotoxin-alpha ( LTalpha ) but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha .,presence;,11;,Gene_expression;
" Furthermore , LTalpha was secreted in NK:EC co-cultures .",secreted;,5;,Localization;
" Co-transfection with dominant-negative mutant TNFRI inhibited EC activation by NK cell membrane extracts and by NK cells by 80 % and 47 % , respectively .",Co-transfection;,1;,Gene_expression;
 The same pattern of inhibition was observed using anti-human LT sera .,,,
" CONCLUSIONS : Human NK cell membrane-bound LT signals across species via TNFRI , leading to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and transcription of E-selectin and IL-8 , which results in EC activation .",leading;transcription;,14;20;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 The discrepancy in the degree of inhibition by membrane extracts and NK cells with mutant TNFRI suggests that additional pathways are utilized by NK cells to activate EC .,,,
" The involvement of multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) -associated factors in the signaling mechanisms of receptor activator of NF-kappaB , a member of the TNFR superfamily .",,,
 Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( RANK ) is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is expressed on activated T cells and dendritic cells .,expressed;,22;,Gene_expression;
 Its cognate ligand ( RANKL ) plays significant roles in the activation of dendritic cell function and osteoclast differentiation .,,,
" We demonstrate here the interaction of RANK with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 both in vitro and in cells .",interaction;,5;,Binding;
 Mapping of the structural requirements for TRAF / RANK interaction revealed multiple TRAF binding sites clustered in two distinct domains in the RANK cytoplasmic tail .,interaction;,10;,Binding;
 These TRAF binding domains were shown to be functionally important for the RANK - dependent induction of NF-kappaB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activities .,,,
 Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these TRAF binding sites exhibited selective binding for different TRAF proteins .,,,
" In particular , TRAF6 interacted with membrane-proximal determinants distinct from those binding TRAFs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 .",interacted;binding;,5;12;,Binding;Binding;
" When this membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted , RANK - mediated NF-kappaB signaling was completely inhibited while c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation was partially inhibited .",,,
" An NH2-terminal truncation mutant of TRAF6 inhibited RANKL - mediated NF-kappaB activation , but failed to affect constitutive signaling induced by receptor overexpression , revealing a selective role for TRAF6 in ligand-induced activation events .",,,
 Regulation of interleukin-1beta transcription by Epstein-Barr virus involves a number of latent proteins via their interaction with RBP .,Regulation;transcription;involves;,1;4;8;,Regulation;Transcription;Regulation;
" Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infects B cells , resulting in the outgrowth of immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .",,,
" Here , we demonstrate through the use of intracellular staining that interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) is expressed in LCLs and investigate the influence of the individual latent proteins on the expression of IL-1beta .",expressed;influence;expression;,17;23;31;,Gene_expression;Regulation;Gene_expression;
" Using RT-PCR , IL-1beta was shown to be up-regulated in EBV-transformed LCLs as well as in group III Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines , compared with group I BL cell lines .",up-regulated;,9;,Positive_regulation;
" The up-regulation of IL-1beta message could be mediated by the latent membrane protein-1 , EBV nuclear proteins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 genes .",up-regulation;mediated;,2;8;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) demonstrated that the -300 region of the IL-1beta promoter , which contains a nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) binding site , contained a functional RBP binding site .",,,
" Binding of RBP to this site could be inhibited by addition of EBV nuclear proteins 3 and 6 , suggesting that these proteins displace RBP from its recognition sequence , removing transcriptional repression and allowing gene transcription to occur .",,,
" In group I BL cells , containing low levels of NF-kappaB , only RBP binding was observed in EMSAs , whereas NF-kappaB binding could be demonstrated in EBV-transformed B cell lines containing high levels of activated NF-kappaB .",,,
" In addition , the expression of latent membrane protein-1 led to activation of NF-kappaB that was capable of binding the IL-1beta promoter .",expression;led;activation;binding;,5;10;12;19;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Binding;

 Characterization of the human elk-1 promoter .,,,
 Potential role of a downstream intronic sequence for elk-1 gene expression in monocytes .,role;,2;,Regulation;
" To characterize the human elk-1 promoter , we mapped the transcriptional start site and isolated elk-1 - specific genomic phage clones that contained extensive upstream and downstream sequences .",,,
 A TATA-like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site .,,,
 Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site ( HS 1 ) in close proximity to the TATA box suggest that the identified TATA motif is important for elk-1 transcription in vivo .,important;transcription;,37;40;,Regulation;Transcription;
 Sequences upstream and downstream from the TATA box were found to contribute to elk-1 promoter activity .,contribute;,12;,Positive_regulation;

 Functional association of Nmi with Stat5 and Stat1 in IL-2 - and IFNgamma - mediated signaling .,,,
" Using the coiled-coil region of Stat5b as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen , we identified the association of Nmi , a protein of unknown function previously reported as an N-Myc interactor .",association;,19;,Binding;
 We further show that Nmi interacts with all STATs except Stat2 .,interacts;,6;,Binding;
" We evaluated two cytokine systems , IL-2 and IFNgamma , and demonstrate that Nmi augments STAT-mediated transcription in response to these cytokines .",,,
" Interestingly , Nmi lacks an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain ; instead , Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5 , and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2 - and IFNgamma - dependent transcription .",enhances;association;,14;16;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" Therefore , our data not only reveal that Nmi can potentiate STAT-dependent transcription , but also suggest that it can augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of sequence-specific transcription factors .",,,
