About Dataset Brief

This research paper presents the development of a robust medical question-answer information base, created to facilitate a data-driven approach in the field of healthcare. Leveraging a multi-source strategy, we meticulously collected information from Chinese medical literature, expert consultations with over 6000 specialists, and data shared by several reputable hospitals. All information was translated into English, ensuring accessibility and usability for a wider audience. Our information base construction was guided by a three-fold process:

 Collection of data from diverse Chinese medical books, allowing us to encompass a broad spectrum of medical knowledge and practices.
 Expert consultations were conducted with an extensive panel of medical specialists, ranging from various domains of medicine, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the gathered information.
 Collaborations with reputable hospitals enriched the database with real-world case studies and empirical insights.


The culmination of our efforts resulted in a comprehensive and versatile medical question-answer information base. The repository now contains a vast array of medical topics, encompassing diagnostics, treatments, pharmaceutical insights, and patient care. The information base is designed to serve as a valuable resource for data-driven research and the testing of medical question-answering models. While our information base presents a significant advancement in medical knowledge accessibility, we emphasize the importance of seeking professional medical advice. Our repository should be considered as an auxiliary tool for research and educational purposes, and we strongly recommend consulting qualified medical professionals before making any medical decisions.
