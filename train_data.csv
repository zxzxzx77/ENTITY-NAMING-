 A region including exon1 in the IRF-4 promoter exhibited a large number of CpG-rich sequences ( Figure 3A ) .,,,
" Several chemical substances such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine ( AzadC ) or 5-azacytidine ( AzaC ) inhibit de novo and maintenance methylation , and thus can be used to discern promoter methylation ( 32,33 ) .",,,
 We used AzadC to generate unmethylated DNA .,,,
" A 72 h AzadC-treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent activation of IRF-4 transcription in Jurkat and CML-T1 T-cells as well as in U-937 , K-562 and EM-2 cell lines ( Figure 2A ) .",activation;transcription;,9;12;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;

 Methylation-sensitive enzymes do not cut specific sites in the IRF-4 promoter in hematopoietic cells,,,
" To further investigate promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism of IRF-4 gene expression , restriction-PCR-assays were performed ( 20,24 ) , where only methylated DNA would not be cut enabling subsequent PCR amplification and vice versa .",expression;,13;,Gene_expression;
" Genomic DNA from leukemic cells Jurkat , CML-T1 , U-937 , K-562 , EM-2 and BV-173 was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII , Bsh1236I and HaeII-isochizomer Bsp143II .",,,
" EcoRI , which has no recognition site within the IRF-4 promoter , and the methylation-resistant enzyme MspI served as controls .",,,
" Two separate amplification reactions were performed , generating two fragments , F1 and F2 ( Figure 3A ) .",,,
" After digestion with HpaII and Bsp143II a sufficient PCR amplification of F1 and F2 was detected in DNA from IRF-4 - negative Jurkat , CML-T1 , U-937 , K-562 and EM-2 cells , suggesting a promoter methylation ( and restriction protection ) at the respective recognition sites ( Figure 3B and C ) .",negative;,22;,Gene_expression;
" Notably , in IRF-4 - positive SD-1 cells digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzymes completely inhibited amplification of F1 and F2 .",positive;,6;,Gene_expression;
" In IRF-4 - positive BV-173 cells a HpaII , but not a Bsh1236I digestion , significantly reduced the amplifiable DNA message of F2 ( Figure 3C ) , whereas amplification of F1 was not affected ( Figure 3B ) .",positive;,4;,Gene_expression;
 This implied that IRF-4 transcription in SD-1 and BV-173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation ( in BV-173 especially at HpaII sites ) as compared with the tested IRF-4 - negative cells .,transcription;negative;,5;32;,Transcription;Gene_expression;
 Specific CpG sites in the IRF-4 promoter are methylated in hematopoietic cells,,,
" In order to exactly map the methylation sites within the IRF-4 promoter , we treated DNA of Jurkat , CML-T1 , U-937 , K-562 and EM-2 cells as well as of SD-1 , RPMI-8226 and BV-173 control cells with bisulfite , which chemically converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil , whereas it has no effect on methylated cytosine , i.e. in CpG ( 34 ) .",,,
 This technique is especially useful for detection of unknown methylation patterns .,,,
" PCR amplification , cloning and sequencing of the bisulfite-treated DNA showed a specific methylation pattern of the analyzed 62 CpG sites in all cell lines ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ) .",,,
" In general , the methylational status ranged from one cell line with a nearly non-methylated IRF-4 promoter ( SD-1 , IRF-4 - positive ) to a completely methylated IRF-4 promoter in CML-T1 ( IRF-4 - negative ) .",positive;negative;,23;36;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" Interestingly , the percentage of CpG methylation in the IRF-4 promoter from IRF-4 - positive cells was very low ( mean 24 % ) as compared with IRF-4 - negative cells ( mean 94 % ) ( Figure 4A and Table 1 ) .",positive;negative;,15;30;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 A 5'-region ( R1 ) with 13 hypermethylated CpG sites ( mean number of methylated clones 5.5 of 8 with 77 % methylated CpGs ) was found in most cells ( except SD-1 and RPMI-8226 ) and a 3'-region ( R3 ) of 6 hypomethylated CpG sites ( mean number of methylated clones 1.7 of 8 with 33 % methylated CpGs ) was found in most cells ( except CML-T1 and U-937 ) ( Figure 4A and Table 1 ) .,,,
" Intriguingly , a stretch of 13 CpG sites ( #10-22 ; R2 ) was detected in between these regions , which were highly methylated in IRF-4 - negative ( mean number of methylated clones 7.1 of 8 with 89 % methylated CpGs ) but totally non-methylated in IRF-4 - positive cells ( Figure 4A and B ) .",negative;positive;,28;50;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" Furthermore , three CpG sites at the 5' end ( #54 , 56 , 58 ) and two CpG motifs at the 3' end ( #1 , 2 ) showed this direct correlation between high methylation status and absence of IRF-4 expression .",absence;expression;,39;42;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;

 In vitro methylation of an IRF-4 promoter-reporter construct decreases its activity,,,
 To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF-4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF-4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation .,,,
 A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases ( Figure 5A ) .,,,
" Intriguingly , methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4 - positive SD-1 cells by 85.0 % ( Figure 5B ) .",decreased;positive;,9;15;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4 - positive cells , since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9 % abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4 - negative Jurkat cells ( Figure 5C ) .",positive;abrogation;negative;,13;25;32;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" In contrast , control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter ( FasL ) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity ( data not shown ) .",,,
 These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter .,,,
 mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-CpG-binding proteins may not be associated with IRF-4 promoter methylation,,,
" Since abundance of DNMT and MBP contribute to promoter regulation via methylation ( 25,26,28 ) , we studied their mRNA expression to investigate a possible mechanism for the observed methylation differences in the IRF-4 promoter .",regulation;,10;,Regulation;
" To this end , we did not detect a significant difference in DNMT ( DNMT1 , DNMT3A and DNMT3B ) or MBP ( MBD1 , MBD2 , MBD4 and MeCP ) mRNA expression between IRF-4 - positive and - negative cells ( Figure 5D ) .",positive;negative;,37;40;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" In fact , all analyzed cells had moderate to high mRNA levels of these tested DNMT/MBPs and differences in expression were not correlated with IRF-4 status .",expression;,20;,Transcription;

 Foxp3 Represses Retroviral Transcription by Targeting Both NF-kappaB and CREB Pathways,,,
 Forkhead box ( Fox ) /winged-helix transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of immune responsiveness and Foxp3 is recognized as an essential functional marker of regulatory T cells .,,,
 Herein we describe downstream signaling pathways targeted by Foxp3 that may negatively impact retroviral pathogenesis .,,,
 Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4 + T cells resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activation .,Overexpression;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal forkhead ( FKH ) domain , critical for nuclear localization and DNA - binding activity , abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF-kappaB activity in HEK 293T cells , but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4 + T cells .",Deletion;critical;localization;binding;,1;11;14;18;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Localization;Binding;
 We further demonstrate that Foxp3 suppressed the transcription of two human retroviral promoters ( HIV-1 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I [ HTLV-I ] ) utilizing NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent mechanisms .,,,
 Examination of the latter identified the cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) pathway as a target of Foxp3 .,,,
" Finally , comparison of the percent Foxp3 + CD4 + CD25 + T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease .",high;expression;,33;35;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 These results suggest an expanded role for Foxp3 in regulating NF-kappaB- and CREB-dependent cellular and viral gene expression .,,,
" Over the past several years , mounting evidence has shown that immune tolerance in healthy individuals can be maintained by a population of T lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) .",,,
" As a component of this system , a protein known as Foxp3 has been shown to be absolutely required for the development and function of Tregs .",,,
" While Foxp3 plays an important role in maintaining immune tolerance by blocking T cell proliferation and production of inflammatory proteins known as cytokines , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are used by Foxp3 to accomplish these events .",,,
 The present study expands our understanding of how Foxp3 maintains a check on inappropriate immune responses by demonstrating that Foxp3 can block activation of key inducible proteins such as nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) .,,,
" Since NF-kappaB and CREB are integrally involved in controlling cell cycle progression , inflammatory cytokine production , and the replication of numerous viruses at the level of transcription , understanding the mechanisms by which Foxp3 functions to regulate cellular and viral gene expression may aid in the discovery of therapeutic approaches designed to rescue the expression and/or function of Foxp3 , which have been found to be deficient in several autoimmune diseases and virus-induced disorders .",expression;expression;,43;56;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Immunological tolerance to self-antigens is the result of the deletion of self-reactive T lymphocytes in the thymus ( central tolerance ) and suppression of the activation of potentially self-reactive T lymphocytes in the periphery ( peripheral tolerance ) [ 1 ] .,,,
" Suppression of pathogenic T cell responses is mediated by naturally arising CD4 + CD25 + T regulatory cells ( Tregs ) [ 2,3 ] .",,,
" Deficiencies in Treg development and function have been linked to the severe autoimmune disorder known as immune dysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy , X-linked syndrome ( IPEX ) [ 4 ] .",,,
" In addition , recent studies have provided strong evidence that dysregulation of Treg development and/or function may be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis [ 5 ] , myasthenia gravis [ 6 ] , and type 1 diabetes [ 7 ] ) and virus-induced immunologic disorders ( e.g. , human T lymphotropic virus type I [ HTLV-I ] -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis [ HAM/TSP ] , and HIV-induced AIDS [ 8-10 ] ) .",,,
 The transcription factor Foxp3 is a 431-amino acid ( 48-kDa ) protein expressed at very high levels in CD4 + CD25 hi T cells and has previously been shown to be absolutely critical for Treg development and function [ 11-14 ] .,expressed;,13;,Gene_expression;
" Foxp3 contains a proline-rich amino-terminal domain reported to function as a nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) binding domain , a central region containing a zinc finger and leucine zipper potentially important for protein-protein interactions , and a carboxyl-terminal forkhead ( FKH ) domain required for nuclear localization and DNA - binding activity [ 14-16 ] .",binding;important;interactions;required;localization;binding;,27;41;44;54;57;61;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Binding;Positive_regulation;Localization;Binding;
" Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region , as demonstrated in IPEX , or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax , as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP , results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4 + CD25 hi T cells [ 4,8,17 ] .",inactivation;affecting;repression;expression;,2;8;20;23;,Negative_regulation;Regulation;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production , very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function .",,,
" The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [ 16 ] , which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters ( e.g. , IL-2 promoter ) .",inhibit;interacting;,34;39;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
 That study also demonstrated that Foxp3 could repress activation of a synthetic reporter vector containing an SV40 promoter and three tandem copies of a forkhead binding site .,,,
 These results provided additional evidence suggesting that Foxp3 transcriptional repression was mediated by binding in a sequence-specific manner to promoters containing forkhead binding sites .,binding;binding;,14;23;,Binding;Binding;
" A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [ 15 ] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation , although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites .",interactions;binding;,35;44;,Binding;Binding;
" Collectively , these data suggested that Foxp3 may function as a transcriptional repressor , potentially through the formation of both DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions .",formation;interactions;,18;24;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" In the present study , we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3 - mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation , and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens .",,,
 The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease .,,,
 Foxp3 Suppresses NF-kappaB Dependent Transcriptional Activation,,,
" To ascertain the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp3 functions to promote the regulatory function of CD4 + CD25 hi T cells , we first confirmed the function of Foxp3 as a repressor of activation of NF-kappaB , previously implicated as a target of other forkhead/winged-helix family transcription factors ( e.g. , Foxj1 and Foxo3a ) [ 19,20 ] .",,,
 We analyzed the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on NF-kappaB activation in HEK 293T cells in dose-response and time course analyses .,overexpression;,7;,Positive_regulation;
" Transfection of HEK 293T cells with an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter vector in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a Foxp3 expression vector or a control vector ( enhanced green fluorescent protein [ EGFP ] ) was performed , and cells were harvested after 24 h to assay for luciferase activity and Foxp3 mRNA expression .",expression;expression;,23;56;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" Results indicated that as the concentration of Foxp3 transfected into cells increases ( from 50 to 2,400 ng ) , the level of NF-kappaB activation decreases proportionally ( Figure 1A ) .",concentration;increases;,6;12;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 Foxp3 mRNA was also assayed to monitor activity of the Foxp3 expression vector ( Figure 1B ) .,expression;,12;,Gene_expression;
" Since NF-kappaB activation was partially affected by transfection of high concentrations of the control vector , we determined the fold inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by Foxp3 compared to the control vector at each concentration ( Figure 1A ) .",,,
 Fold inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was directly proportional to the level of Foxp3 mRNA expression detected by real-time RT-PCR .,,,
" To determine the level of Foxp3 - mediated suppression of NF-kappaB activation over time , HEK 293T cells were transfected with an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter vector and an expression vector encoding Foxp3 or EGFP ( control vector ) and harvested over 4 d .",expression;,29;,Gene_expression;
" As shown in Figure 1C , NF-kappaB activation was suppressed by overexpression of Foxp3 at all time points .",overexpression;,12;,Positive_regulation;
" Extending these results from established , in vitro HEK cell lines to primary human lymphocytes , overexpression of Foxp3 in purified CD4 + T cells from three healthy donors also down-regulated the steady-state level of NF-kappaB activation ( Figure 1D ) .",overexpression;,17;,Positive_regulation;
" These results recapitulate those from Bettelli and colleagues [ 15 ] demonstrating that Foxp3 functions , in part , to block NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in human cell lines as well as in primary human CD4 + T cells .",,,
 The Carboxyl-Terminal FKH Domain Is Not Required for Suppression of NF-kappaB Activation in T Cells,,,
" To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription , we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain ( Figure 2A ) [ 16 ] , similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice , and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [ 4,11,14,17 ] .",lacking;,21;,Negative_regulation;
" Unlike full-length Foxp3 , which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites , the DeltaFKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus can not interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [ 16 ] .",localizes;bind;localize;interact;,6;14;29;37;,Localization;Binding;Localization;Binding;
" Therefore , we utilized the DeltaFKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization ( or other function associated with the FKH domain ) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-kappaB activation .",localization;,12;,Localization;
" Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus , it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus .",interaction;bind;prevent;localization;following;,3;24;31;32;36;,Binding;Binding;Negative_regulation;Localization;Positive_regulation;
" Overexpression of full-length Foxp3 , but not of DeltaFKH , was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-kappaB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells ( Figure 2B ) .",Overexpression;,1;,Positive_regulation;
 Both Foxp3 and DeltaFKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR ( unpublished data ) .,expressed;following;,6;11;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-kappaB-dependent transcription .,,,
" However , NF-kappaB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and DeltaFKH in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 2C ) and primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 2D ) .",,,
 Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and DeltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression ( Figure 2E ) .,expression;block;expression;,7;15;24;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function , because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain , and possibly nuclear localization , are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations .",localization;,24;,Localization;
 Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of DeltaFKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells .,localization;,9;,Localization;
" In either case , these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant .",,,
 Foxp3 Suppresses HIV-1 Gene Expression in Part through Blocking Activation of NF-kappaB,,,
" If Foxp3 functions as a repressor of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression , then we hypothesized that Foxp3 overexpression could selectively down-regulate transcription from promoters previously shown to be responsive to NF-kappaB .",overexpression;,17;,Positive_regulation;
" To address this question , we examined the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR , which contains two tandem cis-acting NF-kappaB binding sites located between positions -102 and -81 with respect to the transcription initiation site [ 21 ] .",,,
 NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression directed from the HIV-1 LTR in CD4 + T cells [ 21 ] .,,,
" Overexpression of full-length Foxp3 , but not DeltaFKH , in HEK 293T cells was able to inhibit basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR ( Figure 3A ) , similar to what was previously demonstrated with the synthetic NF-kappaB reporter vector ( Figure 2B ) .",Overexpression;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , HIV-1 LTR activation was suppressed by full-length Foxp3 and DeltaFKH in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 3B ) .",,,
" To demonstrate that Foxp3 - mediated HIV-1 LTR repression was associated with interactions with NF-kappaB bound to the HIV-1 LTR , we compared basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR or an identical HIV-1 LTR lacking the NF-kappaB sites located between -102 and -81 ( HIV-1 Delta-kappaB LTR ) ( Figure 3C ) .",interactions;,13;,Binding;
 This mutant HIV-1 LTR construct exhibited reduced levels of transcription compared to the parental HIV-1 LTR in purified healthy donor CD4 + T cells ( unpublished data ) .,,,
" However , directly comparing the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on the activation of these two viral promoters demonstrated that Foxp3 was more capable of suppressing transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR ( Figure 3D ) compared to the mutated HIV-1 LTR ( Figure 3E ) .",overexpression;,9;,Positive_regulation;
 These results suggest that Foxp3 down-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activation was mediated at least in part by cis-acting NF-kappaB binding sites .,,,
" Residual levels of inhibition of the HIV-1 Delta-kappaB LTR by Foxp3 may be due to NF-AT binding sites located upstream of the NF-kappaB sites within the HIV-1 LTR [ 22,23 ] .",,,
 The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3,,,
 Previous studies by Bettelli and colleagues have demonstrated that Foxp3 can repress both the basal levels of NF-kappaB activation as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha - stimulated NF-kappaB activation [ 15 ] .,,,
 Our next step was to determine whether Foxp3 could also suppress the activation of NF-kappaB caused by a strong viral transactivator protein .,,,
" HTLV-I encodes a multifunctional transactivator protein , Tax , capable of activating both the NF-kappaB and CREB pathways [ 24-29 ] .",,,
" Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [ 28,29 ] , we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process .",overexpression;,30;,Positive_regulation;
" However , since Tax - dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [ 18 ] , we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax - dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR .",,,
" To test these hypotheses , we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax , full-length Foxp3 , and/or DeltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector .",overexpressed;,7;,Positive_regulation;
" As shown in Figure 4A , HTLV-I Tax strongly up-regulated NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation ( ~60-fold ) .",,,
" Interestingly , overexpression of Foxp3 , but not DeltaFKH , suppressed Tax - mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription .",overexpression;,3;,Gene_expression;
" These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells , strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B .",,,
" Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax ( Figure 4B ) , while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax - dependent HTLV-I LTR activation , although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT ( another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3 ) .",overexpression;transfection;interact;,11;20;54;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Binding;
" Furthermore , overexpression of DeltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 ( Figure 4B ) .",overexpression;,3;,Positive_regulation;
 The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR ( Figure 4C ) .,down-regulating;expression;,16;18;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT , and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain , and therefore localization to the nucleus , are not required for inhibition of Tax - mediated HTLV-I LTR activation ( even in HEK 293T cells ) .",interacts;localization;,7;27;,Binding;Localization;
" To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein , we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain ( Gal4 - BD ) .",associating;,13;,Binding;
" This Gal4-BD-Tax fusion protein activated transcription of a synthetic promoter containing five Gal4 binding sites , while Gal4 - BD was insufficient to stimulate transcription by itself ( Figure 4D ) .",,,
" Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP ( control ) , Foxp3 , or DeltaFKH , suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein .",overexpression;interfacing;,12;35;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;
" To confirm that Foxp3 had a direct effect on HTLV-I replication , we transfected HEK 293T cells with a well-characterized HTLV-I infectious molecular clone ( termed ACH ) [ 30 ] in the presence of full-length Foxp3 , DeltaFKH , or control vector .",,,
" ACH has been previously shown to direct the expression of viral antigens , produce infectious virus , and transform CD4 + T cells both in vitro and in vivo [ 31,32 ] .",,,
" After 24 h , the amount of viral antigen expression , in this case Tax mRNA , was detected by a sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay .",expression;,10;,Transcription;
" As illustrated in Figure 5 , the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector .",synthesized;down-regulated;produced;,12;16;26;,Transcription;Negative_regulation;Transcription;
 DeltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression .,affect;expression;,7;10;,Regulation;Gene_expression;

 Increased Foxp3 Protein Expression Is Associated with Low HTLV-I Proviral Load,Increased;Expression;,1;4;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Since Foxp3 is expressed almost exclusively within CD4 + CD25 + T cells , a major viral reservoir for HTLV-I [ 33 ] , it was important to determine whether there was an association between Foxp3 and HTLV-I replication in infected patients .",expressed;,4;,Gene_expression;
 We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4 + CD25 + T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV-I proviral load ( a surrogate marker of viral replication ) by real-time PCR from eight patients with HAM/TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers ( ACs ) .,expression;,7;,Gene_expression;
 The data from this analysis is summarized in Table 1 .,,,
" As expected , patients with HAM/TSP exhibited significantly higher proviral loads ( indicated as HTLV-I proviral DNA copies/100 cells ) ( 34.68 +/- 23.19 ) compared to ACs ( 4.75 +/- 5.47 ) ( p = 0.0008 ) .",,,
 The percentage of Foxp3 + cells within the CD4 + CD25 + T cell population was significantly greater in ACs ( 43.23 +/- 12.95 ) than in HAM/TSP patients ( 18.59 +/- 5.77 ) ( p = 0.0033 ) .,,,
 These data suggest that high levels of Foxp3 protein expression are associated with reduced HTLV-I replication in vivo .,high;expression;,5;10;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads , which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV-I-infected patients , are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [ 8,34 ] .",high;high;reduced;expression;,8;19;29;31;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 CREB Is a Target for Transcriptional Repression by Foxp3,,,
" Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax - dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR ( Figure 4B ) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone ( Figure 5 ) , Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter ( Figure 4D ) .",inhibit;expression;modulate;,18;20;34;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Regulation;
 These results led us to hypothesize that Foxp3 acts on HTLV-I gene expression by interacting with proteins important for driving HTLV-I LTR activity in vivo .,interacting;,15;,Binding;
 Previous studies have demonstrated that the Tax-responsive elements within the HTLV-I LTR play a crucial role in driving Tax - mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR [ 18 ] .,,,
" The Tax-responsive elements have been shown to resemble CREB binding sites , bind CREB in vitro and in vivo , and facilitate HTLV-I LTR activation both in the presence and in the absence of Tax [ 35,36 ] .",,,
" Ching and colleagues [ 18 ] demonstrated that addition of a dominant-negative CREB expression vector resulted in nearly complete inhibition of Tax - mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR , while blocking NF-kappaB activation by addition of a dominant-negative IKKbeta expression vector had no effect on Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR .",expression;expression;,14;41;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" Therefore , we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway .",,,
" To test this possibility , HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector ( EGFP ) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or DeltaFKH .",,,
" As shown in Figure 6A , Foxp3 down-regulated basal activation of the HTLV-I LTR and transcription of a synthetic CREB reporter vector , suggesting that Foxp3 down-regulates HTLV-I LTR activation by targeting the CREB pathway .",,,
" Deletion of the FKH domain of Foxp3 dampened the suppressive effect of Foxp3 , but did not completely abrogate suppression , as is seen with NF-kappaB-responsive promoters in HEK 293T cells .",Deletion;,1;,Negative_regulation;
" Like NF-kappaB activation , CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3 , and to a similar extent DeltaFKH , in healthy donor CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6B ) .",expression;,12;,Gene_expression;
" Similarly , Foxp3 and DeltaFKH also repressed basal HTLV-I LTR activation in primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6C ) .",,,
" To our knowledge , this is the first evidence implicating CREB as a molecular target of Foxp3 .",,,
" As observed with NF-kappaB activation , DeltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4 + T cells than in HEK 293T cells , further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant .",activation;inhibitor;activation;,5;12;15;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [ 8,45 ] , we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression .",dysregulation;expression;expression;,20;23;38;,Regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

" To our knowledge for the first time , Foxp3 was shown to have a direct effect on HIV-1 LTR transcription .",,,
 Deletion of the NF-kappaB sites within the HIV-1 enhancer region reduced the responsiveness of the HIV-1 LTR to Foxp3 - mediated suppression .,,,
" In addition , the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells , but not in Jurkat T cells , similar to Foxp3 - mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter .",,,
 The direct effect of Foxp3 down-regulating HIV-1 gene expression correlates well with recently reported evidence indicating that higher regulatory activity of CD4 + CD25 + T cells from HIV-1-infected patients was associated with lower HIV-1 viral loads in these patients [ 46 ] .,,,
" Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax : transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and , most surprisingly , transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR .",,,
 Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus .,interaction;,10;,Binding;

" We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax , but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation ( i.e. , NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor , which we identified in this study as CREB ) .",,,
 The negative effect of Foxp3 on HTLV-I gene expression was confirmed utilizing an HTLV-I infectious molecular clone .,,,

 These results have important implications on the utility of Foxp3 in controlling viral gene expression and thus pathogenesis of HAM/TSP .,,,
" Therefore , Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein , especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [ 8 ] .",modulating;expression;expression;down-regulated;,17;19;34;40;,Regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;

" With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity , while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax - dependent transcription by ~50 % , DeltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation ( ~25 % inhibition ) compared to Tax - dependent activation ( ~50 % inhibition ) .",,,
" The effect of DeltaFKH on basal activation of the HTLV-I LTR in HEK 293T cells was very similar to that shown for a synthetic CREB reporter , suggesting that the FKH domain of Foxp3 is important at some level .",,,

" In addition , we identify the CREB pathway as a molecular target of Foxp3 .",,,
" Since CREB has been shown to regulate multiple genes involved in transcription ( e.g. , JunD , c-Fos , signal transducer of activated T cells 3 [ STAT3 ] ) , cell cycle ( e.g. , p15INK4b , cyclin A , cyclin D1 ) , and immune regulation ( e.g. , IL-2 , IL-6 , T-cell receptor alpha ) ( reviewed in [ 48 ] ) , the findings presented in this report broaden the potential range of signaling pathways under the control of the regulatory protein Foxp3 .",regulate;,7;,Regulation;

" However , observing that this inhibitory effect is not absolute , a low level of viral gene expression may persist in CD4 + T cells ( in particular regulatory T cells , which are known reservoirs of HIV-1 and HTLV-I ) and result in the accumulation of viral proteins that either stimulate NF-kappaB and/or CREB activation or directly inhibit Foxp3 expression or function .",expression;inhibit;expression;,18;59;61;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;

 These same pathways can also become sporadically activated in aged mice and also result in lymphoma development .,,,
" This is similar to EBV-associated cancers in vivo , where pathways that are activated by LMP1 are also activated in the less prevalent EBV-negative forms of the cancers [ 40,55-58 ] .",,,
" Thus , the contribution of EBV and LMP1 to tumor development is apparently the continuous activation of pathways that can also be sporadically activated and contribute to tumor development .",,,

 Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs,,,
 Activation of naive CD8 + T cells with antigen induces their differentiation into effector cytolytic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) .,,,
 CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes .,,,

 The T-box transcription factors Eomesodermin ( Eomes ) and T-bet are needed for important aspects of effector and memory CTL differentiation ( 7 ) .,,,

 A cell culture system to monitor effector CTL differentiation,,,
 We used a simple cell culture system to examine the kinetics of effector gene expression during CD8 + T cell differentiation .,,,
" Naive CD8 + T cells from P14 TCR transgenic mice were activated for 2 d with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 or with splenic APCs in the presence of Gp33 peptide , and were cultured in media containing 100 U/ml of recombinant human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ) .",,,
" We used TCR transgenic mice for these experiments because they provide a reliable source of CD8 + T cells that are truly naive ; however , we chose not to stimulate cells with antigen in most experiments so as to avoid contamination with proteins and nucleic acids derived from APCs .",,,
" There were only minor differences in gene expression during differentiation induced by antigen/APC versus anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 , and the major conclusions presented in this report are the same for both activating conditions .",,,
" Under our culture conditions , activated CD8 + T cells expanded exponentially and accumulated for > 8 d .",,,
" We limited our analysis to the first 6-8 d after activation , a period that coincides with clonal expansion of CD8 + T cells after activation in vivo .",,,

" In contrast , granzyme B ( Gzmb ) mRNA was low or undetectable in naive T cells but was strongly up-regulated by day 2 after stimulation and increased progressively until day 6 ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) ; similarly , granzyme B protein was expressed by day 4 and remained high until day 6 ( Fig. 1 E ) .",up-regulated;increased;,21;28;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 We evaluated antigen-dependent cytolytic function in a short-term assay in which target cell death was measured within 2 h ( Fig. 1 F ) .,,,
" By limiting the duration of TCR stimulation , this strategy minimizes cytolysis secondary to new gene expression during the period of the assay .",,,
" Naive T cells did not display significant cytolytic function in this short-term assay ( unpublished data ) , most likely because they express immature ( unprocessed ) forms of perforin and lack the capacity to degranulate ( 18 , 19 ) .",express;,23;,Gene_expression;
" Even after activation for 2 or 4 d , the cells showed poor cytolytic activity ( Fig. 1 F ) , in striking contrast to their capacity for efficient cytokine production ( Fig. 1 E ) .",,,
" Only cells cultured until day 6 displayed robust cytotoxicity , as judged by their ability to induce apoptosis in a large number of target cells ( Fig. 1 F ) .",,,
" These results show that after a strong priming stimulus through TCRs and co-stimulatory receptors in vitro , granzyme B expression and the ability to produce effector cytokines are programmed early , whereas perforin expression and cytolytic function are induced later , during the phase of clonal expansion in IL-2 .",expression;expression;induced;,20;34;39;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

" After 48 hr , they were injected subcutaneously with PBS or with OVA protein ( 5 mg ) plus LPS ( 5 mug ) .",,,

 A single-cell suspension ( 1 x 106 cells ) was restimulated for 24 or 48 hr with 1 muM or 3 muM of OVA and with BrefeldinA for the last 6 hr .,,,
 Half of the supernatant was removed before the addition of BrefeldinA for use in an ELISA assay .,,,
 The cells were fixed and stained as before .,,,
" Those positive for KJ1-26 - Bio and for CD4 - PerCP were gated , and IFN-gamma and IL-10 staining was examined for this population and analyzed as before .",,,
 Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR,,,
 Cells were harvested and restimulated in the presence of immobilized anti - CD3 ( 2 mug/ml ) plus anti - CD28 ( 2 mug/ml ) for 3 hr or immediately lysed .,,,
" RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed and cDNA was analyzed for the expression of cytokines and transcription factors by real-time PCR assay as before ( Shoemaker etal. , 2006 ) .",,,
" Target gene mRNA expression was quantified either with SYBR Green ( Applied Biosystems ) or with Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and normalized to ubiquitin or HPRT mRNA levels , respectively .",,,
 Differentiated CD4 + Tcells were rested for 5 hr in 1 % FCS-containing medium and restimulated as described for specific experiments .,,,

 Reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent NF-kappaB activation by interleukin-1beta requires 5-lipoxygenase or NADPH oxidase activity .,,,
 We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in NF-kappaB activation by proinflammatory cytokines was cell specific .,,,
" However , the sources for ROIs in various cell types are yet to be determined and might include 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and NADPH oxidase .",,,
 5-LOX and 5-LOX activating protein ( FLAP ) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells .,coexpressed;,10;,Gene_expression;
" Stimulation of lymphoid cells with interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) led to ROI production and NF-kappaB activation , which could both be blocked by antioxidants or FLAP inhibitors , confirming that 5-LOX was the source of ROIs and was required for NF-kappaB activation in these cells .",,,
 IL-1beta stimulation of epithelial cells did not generate any ROIs and NF-kappaB induction was not influenced by 5-LOX inhibitors .,,,
" However , reintroduction of a functional 5-LOX system in these cells allowed ROI production and 5-LOX - dependent NF-kappaB activation .",,,
" In monocytic cells , IL-1beta treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the 5-LOX enzyme but requires the NADPH oxidase activity .",,,
" This pathway involves the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases , two enzymes which are not required for NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta in epithelial cells .",,,
" In conclusion , three different cell-specific pathways lead to NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta : a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5-LOX in lymphoid cells , an ROI- and 5-LOX - independent pathway in epithelial cells , and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells .",,,

 Interleukin-10 inhibits expression of both interferon alpha- and interferon gamma - induced genes by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 .,suppressing;phosphorylation;,15;17;,Negative_regulation;Phosphorylation;
 Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) helps maintain polarized T-helper cells in a T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) phenotype .,,,
" Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of Th1 cells , which are a primary source of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , a potent activator of monocytes and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation .",,,
" Because monocytes and macrophages are important mediators of Th1-type responses , such as delayed-type hypersensitivity , we sought to determine if IL-10 could directly mediate inhibition of IFNgamma - and IFNalpha-induced gene expression in these cells .",,,
 Highly purified monocytes were incubated with IL-10 for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition of IFNgamma or IFNalpha .,,,

 The GATA-3 transcription factor is required for development of the T-cell lineage and Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T-cells .,,,
 We have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive ( HS ) regions of the human GATA-3 gene in T-cells and non-T-cells and studied their transcriptional activities .,transcriptional;,22;,Transcription;
" HS I-III , located 5' from the transcriptional initiation site , were found in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells , whereas HS IV-VII , located 3' from the transcriptional start site , were exclusively observed in T-cells .",,,
" Among these hypersensitive sites , two transcriptional control elements were found , one in the first intron of the GATA-3 gene and the other between 8.3 and 5.9 kilobases 5' from the GATA-3 transcriptional initiation site .",,,
 The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity .,,,

 AML and Ets proteins regulate the I alpha1 germ-line promoter .,,,
 The immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) class switch recombination of B lymphocytes preferentially targets unrearranged IgH genes that have already been rendered transcriptionally active .,,,
 Transcription of the germ-line IgH genes is controlled by intervening ( I ) regions upstream of their switch regions .,,,
 The I alpha1 promoter activates transcription of the human germ-line C alpha1 gene for IgA1 and mediates the transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1 responsiveness of this locus .,,,
 Here we show that the I alpha1 promoter contains several binding sites for the AML/PEBP2/CBF family of transcription factors and that AML and Ets proteins are major regulators of the basal and TGF-beta-inducible promoter activity .,,,
 Our data constitute a starting point for studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TGF-beta regulates IgA production .,,,
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with diabetic nephropathy show increased activation of the oxidative-stress sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB .,,,
 Increased oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been linked to the development of late diabetic complications .,,,
 To determine whether oxidative stress dependent NF-kappaB activation is evident in patients with diabetic nephropathy we used an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay based semiquantitative detection system which enabled us to determine NF-kappaB activation in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .,,,
 We examined 33 patients with diabetes mellitus ( Type I and Type II ) .,,,
 Patients with diabetic nephropathy showed higher NF-kappaB binding activity in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and stronger immunohistological staining for activated NF-kappaBp65 than patients without renal complications .,stronger;activated;,16;20;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with the degree of albuminuria ( r = 0.316 ) and with thrombomodulin plasma concentrations ( r = 0.33 ) , indicative for albuminuria associated endothelial dysfunction .",,,
 In a 3 day intervention study in which 600 mg of the antioxidant thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) per day were given to nine patients with diabetic nephropathy oxidative stress in plasma samples was decreased by 48 % and NF-kappaB binding activity in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 38 % .,,,
" In conclusion , activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with diabetes mellitus correlates with the degree of diabetic nephropathy .",,,
 NF-kappaB activation is at least in part dependent on oxidative stress since thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) reduced NF-kappaB binding activity .,,,
 Activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by Gardnerella vaginalis .,,,
" Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 , and Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with BV .",,,
 G. vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate HIV expression in monocytoid cells .,,,
 Stimulation was significantly higher when lysates were heated at 100 degrees C for 5 min but was reduced by treatment with lysozyme or protease .,,,
 G. vaginalis lysates also activated HIV expression in certain T cell lines .,,,
" G. vaginalis lysates activated HIV long-terminal repeat transcription in HIV-infected cells and increased NF-kappaB binding activity , indicating an effect by G. vaginalis on HIV transcription .",,,
 The activation of HIV production by G. vaginalis suggests that genital tract infection with G. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by increasing HIV expression in the genital tract .,,,
" This may explain , at least in part , the increased rate of HIV transmission in women with BV .",,,

 Gold compounds have been effectively used for many decades in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis .,,,
" We previously reported that gold compounds , especially aurothioglucose ( AuTG ) containing monovalent gold ion , inhibited the DNA-binding of NF-kappaB in vitro .",,,
 In this report we have examined the efficacy of the gold compound AuTG as an inhibitor of HIV replication in latently infected OM10.1 and Ach2 cells .,,,
" Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha - induced HIV-1 replication in OM10.1 or Ach2 cells was significantly inhibited by non-cytotoxic doses of AuTG ( > 10 microM in OM10.1 cells and > 25 F.M in Ach2 cells ) , while 25 microM of the counter-anion thioglucose ( TG ) or gold compound containing divalent gold ion , HAuCl3 , had no effect .",,,
 The effect of AuTG on NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression was confirmed by a transient CAT assay .,,,
" Specific staining as well as electron microscopic examinations revealed the accumulation of metal gold in the cells , supporting our previous hypothesis that gold ions could block NF-kappaB-DNA binding by a redox mechanism .",,,
 These observations indicate that the monovalent gold compound AuTG is a potentially useful drug for the treatment of patients infected with HIV .,,,

 Nuclear factor-kappa B activity in T cells from patients with rheumatic diseases : a preliminary report .,,,
 OBJECTIVE : The NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the expression of many genes involved in the immune or inflammatory response at the transcriptional level .,,,
 The aim of this study was to determine whether distinctive patterns of NF-kappa B activation are seen in different forms of joint disease .,,,
 METHODS : The DNA binding activity of these nucleoproteins was examined in purified synovial and peripheral T cells from patients with various chronic rheumatic diseases ( 12 : four with rheumatoid arthritis ; five with spondyloarthropathies ; and three with osteoarthritis ) .,,,
 RESULTS : Electrophoretic mobility shift assays disclosed two specific complexes bound to a NF-kappa B specific 32P-labelled oligonucleotide in nucleoproteins extracted from purified T cells isolated from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis .,,,
 The complexes consisted of p50 / p50 homodimers and p50 / p65 heterodimers .,,,
 Increased NF-kappa B binding to DNA in synovial T cells was observed relative to peripheral T cells .,,,
" In non-rheumatoid arthritis , binding of NF-kappa B in synovial T cells was exclusively mediated by p50 / p50 homodimers .",,,
" CONCLUSION : Overall , the results suggest that NF-kappa B may play a central part in the activation of infiltrating T cells in chronic rheumatoid arthritis .",,,
" The activation of this nuclear factor is qualitatively different in rheumatoid synovial T cells to that in other forms of non-rheumatoid arthritis ( for example , osteoarthritis , spondyloarthropathies ) .",,,
 N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits primary human T cell responses at the dendritic cell level : association with NF-kappaB inhibition .,,,
 N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) is an antioxidant molecule endowed with immunomodulatory properties .,,,
" To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T cell responses , we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells ( DC ) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF .",,,
 We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .,,,
" In parallel , NAC was shown to down-regulate the production of cytokines by DC as well as their surface expression of HLA-DR , CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and CD40 molecules both at the basal state and upon LPS activation .",down-regulate;expression;activation;,8;20;40;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by CD40 engagement .,engagement;,9;,Binding;
 The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of DC nor their mannose receptor - mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC .,,,
" Finally , we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses , which could be attributed to a defect of DC as APC-independent T cell responses were not inhibited by NAC .",,,
" Altogether , our results suggest that NAC might impair the generation of primary immune responses in humans through its inhibitory action on DC .",,,
 Bacterial lipopolysaccharide activates nuclear factor-kappaB through interleukin-1 signaling mediators in cultured human dermal endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes .,,,
" Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -mediated immune responses , including activation of monocytes , macrophages , and endothelial cells , play an important role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis syndrome .",,,
" Activation of NF-kappaB is thought to be required for cytokine release from LPS-responsive cells , a critical step for endotoxic effects .",,,
 Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-alpha ) signal transducer molecules in LPS signaling in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells ( HDMEC ) and THP-1 monocytic cells .,,,
 LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP-1 cells initiated an IL-1 receptor-like NF-kappaB signaling cascade .,,,
" In transient cotransfection experiments , dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway , including MyD88 , IRAK , IRAK2 , and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1- and LPS-induced NF-kappaB-luciferase activity .",,,
 LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF signaling .,,,

" These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor ( TLR ) super family , and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells .",,,
 Selective activation and functional significance of p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils .,,,
 Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of kinases .,,,
" Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of human neutrophils is known to result in activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ; however , the upstream activator(s) of p38 MAPk is unknown , and consequences of p38 MAPk activation remain largely undefined .",,,
" We investigated the MAPk kinase ( MKK ) that activates p38 MAPk in response to LPS , the p38 MAPk isoforms that are activated as part of this pathway , and the functional responses affected by p38 MAPk activation .",,,
" Although MKK3 , MKK4 , and MKK6 all activated p38 MAPk in experimental models , only MKK3 was found to activate recombinant p38 MAPk in LPS-treated neutrophils .",,,

 Molecular mechanisms of neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion induced by redox imbalance .,,,
 Previous studies have implicated a role for intracellular thiols in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and transcriptional regulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules .,,,
 This study was designed to determine whether changes in endothelial cell glutathione ( GSH ) or oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) can alter neutrophil adhesivity and to define the molecular mechanism that underlies this GSSG/GSH-induced adhesion response .,,,
 Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers for 6 hours with 0.2 mmol/L diamide and 1 mmol/L buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) decreased GSH levels and increased the ratio of GSSG to GSH without cell toxicity .,,,
 These redox changes are similar to those observed with anoxia/reoxygenation .,,,
 Diamide plus BSO-induced thiol/disulfide imbalance was associated with a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs with peak responses observed at 15 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) .,,,
" N-Acetylcysteine treatment attenuated neutrophil adhesion in both phases , which indicated a role for GSH in the adhesion responses .",,,
" Interestingly , phase 1 adhesion was inversely correlated with GSH levels but not with the GSSG/GSH ratio , whereas phase 2 neutrophil adhesion was positively correlated with GSSG/GSH ratio but not with GSH levels .",,,
" Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin - specific monoclonal antibodies attenuated the increased neutrophil adhesion during both phases , whereas an anti - E-selectin monoclonal antibody also attenuated the phase 2 response .",,,
" Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides that contained nuclear factor-kappaB or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated the phase 2 response , which implicated a role for de novo protein synthesis .",,,
" Surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , P-selectin , and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase 1 and 2 neutrophil adhesion responses .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;

 The therapeutic potential of drugs that block the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 has been emphasized .,,,
" When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [ 2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid ( triflusal ) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid ( HTB ) ] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors , we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood , triflusal , aspirin , and HTB , but not sodium salicylate , inhibited COX-2 - mediated prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production ( IC50 = 0.16 , 0.18 , 0.39 , and > 10 mM , respectively ) .",,,

" This different behavior may be , at least in part , due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB to a higher extent than aspirin and sodium salicylate .",,,

" A monoclonal antibody specific to the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide was able to inhibit activation of the NF-kappaB-like factor by PGG-Glucan , and ligand binding data , including polysaccharide specificity , suggested that the PGG-Glucan binding moiety was lactosylceramide .",,,

 [ Corticoids and allergy ],,,
 Inflammation is constantly observed in allergic reactions .,,,
 Corticosteroids are most effective in preventing the late phase of allergic reaction .,,,
 The action of glucocorticosteroids is mediated through glucocorticoid receptors present in the cellular cytoplasm .,,,
" When activated , glucocorticoid receptors form a dimer and bind to DNA after migration into the nucleus .",,,
" Interaction to DNA induces changes in the transcription rate , leading to either gene induction or gene repression .",,,
 Glucocorticoid receptors are also able to interact with transcriptional factors such as AP-1 ( activator protein-1 ) of NF-kappa B ( nuclear factor-kappa B ) .,,,
 Through these actions glucocorticosteroids are susceptible to modify functions of cells involved in the allergic inflammatory response .,,,
 They are in particular able to inhibit most of the pro-inflammatory functions of the eosinophils .,,,

" First , we showed that viral binding induced a number of immunoregulatory genes ( IL-1beta , A20 , NF-kappaB - p105 / p50 , and IkappaBalpha ) in unactivated monocytes and that neutralizing Abs to the major HCMV glycoproteins , gB ( UL55 ) and gH ( UL75 ) , inhibited the induction of these genes .",induced;inhibited;induction;,8;51;53;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Next , we demonstrated that these viral ligands directly up-regulated monocyte gene expression upon their binding to their appropriate cellular receptors .",,,
 We then investigated if HCMV binding also resulted in the translation and secretion of cytokines .,,,
 Our results showed that HCMV binding to monocytes resulted in the production and release of IL-1beta protein .,resulted;production;release;,9;12;14;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Localization;
" Because these induced gene products have NF-kappaB sites in their promoter regions , we next examined whether there was an up-regulation of nuclear NF-kappaB levels .",,,
" These experiments showed that , in fact , NF-kappaB was translocated to the nucleus following viral binding or purified viral ligand binding .",,,
 Changes in IkappaBalpha levels correlated with the changes in NF-kappaB translocation .,Changes;,1;,Regulation;
" Lastly , we demonstrated that p38 kinase activity played a central role in IL-1beta production and that it was rapidly up-regulated following infection .",role;production;,12;15;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" These results support our hypothesis that HCMV initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to monocyte activation and pinpoints a potential mechanism whereby HCMV infection of monocytes can result in profound pathogenesis , especially in chronic inflammatory-type conditions .",,,
 Signal transduction pathways activated in endothelial cells following infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae .,,,
 Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen .,,,
" Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions .",,,
" In this study , we characterized C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of endothelial cells and demonstrated an enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of leukocytes ( monocytes , granulocytes ) .",,,
 These effects were blocked by mAbs against endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules ( beta1 and beta2 integrins ) .,,,
" Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in C. pneumoniae-infected endothelial cells was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated p42 / p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and NF-kappaB activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min .",up-regulation;occurred;,21;34;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted within hours .",Increased;expression;,1;5;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

" By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the Raf1 / MEK1 / ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B .",,,
" Interestingly , it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein .",transcription;dependent;interaction;,10;28;35;,Transcription;Positive_regulation;Binding;

 Fludarabine-induced immunosuppression is associated with inhibition of STAT1 signaling .,,,
 Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies that can induce severe and prolonged immunosuppression .,,,
" Although it can be incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells , fludarabine is also a potent inhibitor of cells with a low growth fraction , thus it must have other mechanisms of action .",,,

 Suppressive effects of anti-inflammatory agents on human endothelial cell activation and induction of heat shock proteins .,,,
 BACKGROUND : Studies from our laboratory have shown that the earliest stages of atherosclerosis may be mediated by an autoimmune reaction against heat shock protein 60 ( Hsp60 ) .,,,
 The interactions of Hsp60 - specific T cells with arterial endothelial cells ( EC ) require expression of both Hsp60 and certain adhesion molecules shown to be induced simultaneously in EC by mechanical and other types of stress .,expression;,17;,Gene_expression;
" Recently , it was shown that suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses by cyclosporin A ( CyA ) enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice .",,,
" In contrast , aspirin was found to lower the risk of myocardial infarction in men .",,,
" These conflicting observations may be due to different effects of anti-inflammatory agents on adhesion molecule and Hsp expression in EC , respectively .",,,
" MATERIAL AND METHODS : In the present study , we analyzed the effects of CyA , aspirin , and indomethacin on T cell proliferation using a proliferation assay .",,,
" To explore the expression of adhesion molecules , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , and Hsp60 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , Northern blot analyses were used .",expression;,4;,Gene_expression;
" To examine the activation status of the transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and heat shock factor-1 ( HSF-1 ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed .",activation;,4;,Positive_regulation;
" RESULTS : With the exception of indomethacin , the used immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents significantly inhibited T cell proliferation in response to influenza virus antigen in a dose-dependent manner .",,,
" Interestingly , CyA and indomethacin did not suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -induced adhesion molecule expression on HUVECs , whereas aspirin had an inhibitory effect .",,,
 These observations correlated with the modulation of NF-kappaB activity in EC .,,,
 All agents tested induced expression of Hsp60 6 hr after application .,induced;expression;,4;5;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" In addition , aspirin and indomethacin , but not CyA , induced Hsp70 expression in HUVECs that correlated with induction of HSF-1 activity .",induced;expression;induction;,12;14;20;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

 These data provide the molecular basis for the notion that ( 1 ) part of the anti-atherogenic effect of aspirin may be due to the prevention of the adhesion of sensitized T cells to stressed EC ; ( 2 ) that part of the atherosclerosis-promoting effect of CyA may be due to its potential as an inducer of Hsp60 expression and its inability to down-regulate adhesion molecule expression on EC ; and ( 3 ) that down-regulation of MCP-1 expression by aspirin may result in decreased recruitment of monocytes into the arterial intima beneath stressed EC .,inducer;expression;expression;down-regulation;expression;,57;60;68;77;80;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Amelioration of rat cerulein pancreatitis by guamerin-derived peptide , a novel elastase inhibitor .",,,
" Increased activity of various proteases is observed in both human and experimental pancreatitis ; however , the information on the effects of specific protease inhibitors on the disease is limited .",,,
" In this study we show that a novel elastase inhibitor , guamerin-derived synthetic peptide ( GDSP ) , improves the parameters of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat .",,,
" The effects of GDSP on pancreatic weight , serum amylase and lipase , morphologic changes in the pancreas , neutrophil infiltration , and nuclear factor KB ( NF-KB ) activation were measured in rats infused with supramaximal dose of cerulein ( 5 ( g/kg/h ) for 6 h .",,,
 The effects of GDSP were also measured on superoxide formation by activated human neutrophils .,,,
" The effects of GDSP were compared with those of another elastase inhibitor , elastatinal .",,,
" GDSP significantly inhibited edema formation , neutrophil infiltration , acinar cell damage , and plasma lipase and amylase increases caused by cerulein .",,,
 GDSP also completely inhibited superoxide formation in the human neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenyl-alanine ( fMLP ) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .,,,
 Elastatinal had some of the same effects as GDSP but was less potent and effective .,,,
" These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of GDSP , a novel specific elastase inhibitor , on the development of rat cerulein pancreatitis .",,,
 Inhibition of T cell signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase-targeted hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) .,,,
" Activation of T lymphocytes to produce cytokines is regulated by the counterbalance of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases , many of which have a high degree of substrate specificity because of physical association with their targets .",,,
 Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5' promoter of the interleukin-2 gene .,Overexpression;activation;activation;binding;,1;15;23;27;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Binding;
 Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells .,acts;reduces;,20;35;,Regulation;Negative_regulation;
" In contrast , HePTP had no effects on N-terminal c-Jun kinase or on events upstream of the MAP kinases .",,,
" The specificity of HePTP correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic N terminus with Erk and another MAP kinase , p38 , but not Jnk or other proteins .",,,
 We propose that HePTP plays a negative role in antigen receptor signaling by specifically regulating MAP kinases in the cytosol and at early time points of T cell activation before the activation-induced expression of nuclear dual-specific MAP kinase phosphatases .,,,
 Angiotensin II activates the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB in human monocytes .,,,
 The renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .,,,
 A common feature of all stages of atherosclerosis is inflammation of the vessel wall .,,,
 The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation .,,,
" This study therefore examined the effect of angiotensin ( ANG ) II on NF-kappaB activation in monocytic cells , a major cellular component of human atheroma , by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .",,,
" ANG II , like TNFalpha , caused rapid activation of NF-kappaB in human mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density gradient .",,,
 This ANG II effect was blocked by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan .,,,
 Specificity of ANG II-induced NF-kappaB activation was ascertained by supershift and competition experiments .,,,
" Moreover , ANG II stimulated NF-kappaB activation in human monocytes , but not in lymphocytes from the same preparation .",,,
" Together , the data demonstrate the ability of the vasoactive peptide ANG II to activate inflammatory pathways in human monocytes .",,,

" SHP2-interacting transmembrane adaptor protein ( SIT ) , a novel disulfide-linked dimer regulating human T cell activation .",,,
 T lymphocytes express several low molecular weight transmembrane adaptor proteins that recruit src homology (SH)2 domain-containing intracellular molecules to the cell membrane via tyrosine-based signaling motifs .,,,
 We describe here a novel molecule of this group termed SIT ( SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein ) .,,,

" However , binding of SHP2 to SIT is not required for inhibition of NF-AT induction , suggesting that SIT not only regulates NF-AT activity but also controls NF-AT unrelated pathways of T cell activation involving SHP2 .",binding;,3;,Binding;

 We report the cloning and characterization of a novel Grb2 - like adaptor molecule designated as Grb2-related protein of the lymphoid system ( GrpL ) .,,,
" Expression of GrpL is restricted to hematopoietic tissues , and it is distinguished from Grb2 by having a proline-rich region .",Expression;,1;,Gene_expression;
 GrpL can be coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 but not with Sos1 or Sos2 from Jurkat cell lysates .,coimmunoprecipitated;,4;,Binding;
" In contrast , Grb2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Sos1 and Sos2 but not with SLP-76 .",coimmunoprecipitated;,7;,Binding;
" Moreover , tyrosine - phosphorylated LAT / pp36/38 in detergent lysates prepared from anti-CD3 stimulated T cells associated with Grb2 but not GrpL .",phosphorylated;associated;,5;18;,Phosphorylation;Binding;
 These data reveal the presence of distinct complexes involving GrpL and Grb2 in T cells .,,,
 A functional role of the GrpL - SLP-76 complex is suggested by the ability of GrpL to act alone or in concert with SLP-76 to augment NF-AT activation in Jurkat T cells .,,,

 Cellular disposition of sulphamethoxazole and its metabolites : implications for hypersensitivity .,,,
 1. Bioactivation of sulphamethoxazole ( SMX ) to chemically-reactive metabolites and subsequent protein conjugation is thought to be involved in SMX hypersensitivity .,,,
" We have therefore examined the cellular metabolism , disposition and conjugation of SMX and its metabolites in vitro .",,,

" Flow cytometry revealed binding of N-hydroxy ( SMX-NHOH ) and nitroso ( SMX-NO ) metabolites of SMX , but not of SMX itself , to the surface of viable white blood cells .",,,
 Cellular haptenation by SMX-NO was reduced by exogenous glutathione ( GSH ) .,,,

" SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO were rapidly reduced back to the parent compound by cysteine ( CYS ) , GSH , human peripheral blood cells and plasma , suggesting that this is an important and ubiquitous bioinactivation mechanism .",,,

" Fluorescence HPLC showed that SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO depleted CYS and GSH in buffer , and to a lesser extent , in cells and plasma .",,,
 5 .,,,
" Neutrophil apoptosis and inhibition of neutrophil function were induced at lower concentrations of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO than those inducing loss of membrane viability , with SMX having no effect .",,,
 Lymphocytes were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more sensitive to the direct cytotoxic effects of SMX-NO than neutrophils .,,,

 Partitioning of SMX-NHOH into red blood cells was significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower than with the hydroxylamine of dapsone .,,,

 Our results suggest that the balance between oxidation of SMX to its toxic metabolites and their reduction is an important protective cellular mechanism .,,,
" If an imbalance exists , haptenation of the toxic metabolites to bodily proteins including the surface of viable cells can occur , and may result in drug hypersensitivity .",,,
 Tcf-1 - mediated transcription in T lymphocytes : differential role for glycogen synthase kinase-3 in fibroblasts and T cells .,,,
 Beta-catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene Armadillo and plays roles in both cell-cell adhesion and transduction of the Wnt signaling cascade .,,,
" Recently , members of the Lef/Tcf transcription factor family have been identified as protein partners of beta-catenin , explaining how beta-catenin alters gene expression .",,,
" Here we report that in T cells , Tcf-1 also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with beta-catenin , suggesting that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is operational in T lymphocytes as well .",interaction;,15;,Binding;
" However , although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin , we find no evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells .",inhibit;,9;,Negative_regulation;
" That is , a dominant negative GSK-3beta does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli ( lithium or phytohemagglutinin ) that inhibit GSK-3beta activity also do not activate Tcf reporter genes .",inhibit;,22;,Negative_regulation;

 CIITA - induced occupation of MHC class II promoters is independent of the cooperative stabilization of the promoter-bound multi-protein complexes .,,,
 Precise regulation of MHC class II expression plays a crucial role in the control of the immune response .,,,
" The transactivator CIITA behaves as a master controller of constitutive and inducible MHC class II gene activation , but its exact mechanism of action is not known .",,,
" Activation of MHC class II promoters requires binding of at least three distinct multi-protein complexes ( RFX , X2BP and NF-Y ) .",,,
 It is known that the stability of this binding results from cooperative interactions between these proteins .,,,
 We show here that expression of CIITA in MHC class II- cells triggers occupation of the promoters by these complexes .,expression;,5;,Gene_expression;
 This observation raised the possibility that the effect of CIITA on promoter occupation is mediated by an effect on the cooperative stabilization of the DNA-bound multi-protein complexes .,,,
" We show , however , that the presence of CIITA does not affect the stability of the higher-order protein complex formed on DNA by RFX , X2BP and NF-Y .",,,
" This suggests other mechanisms for CIITA - induced promoter occupancy , such as an effect on chromatin structure leading to increased accessibility of MHC class II promoters .",,,
 This ability of CIITA to facilitate promoter occupation is undissociable from its transactivation potential .,,,
" Finally , we conclude that this effect of CIITA is cell-type specific , since expression of CIITA is not required for normal occupation of MHC class II promoters in B lymphocytes .",expression;,15;,Gene_expression;

" PG490 can completely inhibit transcriptional activation at the purine-box/ARRE/NF-AT and NF-kappaB target DNA sequences triggered by all stimuli examined ( PMA , PMA/Iono , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) .",,,
 PG490 also inhibits PMA-stimulated activation of a chimeric transcription factor in which the C-terminal TA1 transactivation domain of NF-kappaB p65 is fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 .,,,

 Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB by lipopolysaccharide in mononuclear leukocytes is prevented by inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 .,,,
" In monocytes , lipopolysaccharide induces synthesis and activity of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 .",,,
 This enzyme releases arachidonic acid and lyso-phospholipids from membranes which are metabolized to eicosanoids and platelet-activating-factor .,,,
 These lipid mediators increase activity of transcription factors and expression of cytokine genes indicating a function for cytosolic phospholipase A2 in signal transduction and inflammation .,,,
 We have shown previously that trifluoromethylketone inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 suppressed interleukin-1beta protein and steady-state mRNA levels in human lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes .,suppressed;,12;,Negative_regulation;

" On first encounter with antigen , naive CD4 + T helper ( Th ) cells differentiate into cytokine-producing effector cells .",,,
 Two types of effector cells characterized by their distinct expression of cytokine profiles have been described .,,,
" Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma , whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 .",produce;produce;,3;11;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" In many pathological situations , the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses determines the outcome of diverse immunologically mediated clinical syndromes including infectious , autoimmune , and allergic diseases .",,,
" However , the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of Th1/Th2-like cytokines has remained elusive .",,,
 In this review we evaluate the possible in vivo role of different transcription factors and transcriptional mechanisms in T cell differentiation and the immune response .,,,
 The evolutionarily conserved sequence upstream of the human Ig heavy chain S gamma 3 region is an inducible promoter : synergistic activation by CD40 ligand and IL-4 via cooperative NF-kappa B and STAT-6 binding sites .,,,
" Germline C gamma gene transcription is a crucial event in the process that leads to switch DNA recombination to IgG , but its regulation in the human is poorly understood .",,,
" We took advantage of our monoclonal model of germinal center B cell differentiation , IgM+ IgD+ CL-01 cells , to define the role of the I gamma 3 evolutionarily conserved sequence ( ECS ) in the germline transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .",role;activation;,23;39;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;
" The I gamma 3 ECS lies upstream of the major I gamma 3 transcription initiation site and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding human I gamma 1 , I gamma 2 , and I gamma 4 regions .",,,
" Reporter luciferase gene vectors containing the human gamma 3 ECS were used to transfect CL-01 cells , which have been shown to undergo Smu --> S gamma 3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of CD40 by CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) and exposure to IL-4 .",engagement;,33;,Binding;
" In these transfected CL-01 cells , CD40 : CD40L engagement and exposure to IL-4 synergistically induced gamma 3 ECS-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation .",engagement;,10;,Binding;
" Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem NF-kappa B/Rel binding motif is critical for the gamma 3 ECS responsiveness to both CD40L and IL-4 , while a STAT-6 - binding site is additionally required for IL-4 inducibility .",inducibility;,37;,Positive_regulation;
" Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that p50 / p65 / c-Rel and STAT-6 are effectively induced by CD40L and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to specific DNA motifs within the ECS .",induced;bind;,16;25;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
 These partially overlapping CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation .,,,
" Thus , the gamma 3 ECS is an inducible promoter containing cis elements that critically mediate CD40L and IL-4 - triggered transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .",,,
 Thrombin - induced p65 homodimer binding to downstream NF-kappa B site of the promoter mediates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion .,induced;binding;mediates;expression;,3;6;15;18;,Positive_regulation;Binding;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" We investigated the mechanisms by which proinflammatory mediator , thrombin , released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury , induces ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) expression in endothelial cells .",released;induces;expression;,12;20;25;,Localization;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

" Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene ( ICAM-1LUC ) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream NF-kappa B site ( -533 bases from translation start site ) had no effect on thrombin responsiveness , whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-kappa B site ( -223 bases from the translation start site ) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter , indicating that the downstream NF-kappa B site is critical for thrombin inducibility .",prevented;activation;,55;57;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" NF-kappa B-directed luciferase activity increased approximately 3-fold when cells transfected with the plasmid pNF-kappa BLUC containing five copies of consensus NF-kappa B site linked to a minimal adenovirus E1B promoter-luciferase gene were exposed to thrombin , indicating that activation of NF-kappa B was essential for thrombin response .",,,
 Gel supershift assays demonstrated that thrombin induced binding of NF-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) to downstream NF-kappa B site of the ICAM-1 promoter .,induced;binding;,7;8;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" Thrombin receptor activation peptide , a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH2 terminus of proteolytically activated receptor-1 , mimicked thrombin 's action in inducing ICAM-1 expression .",inducing;expression;,24;26;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 These data indicate that thrombin activates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion by NF-kappa B p65 binding to the downstream NF-kappa B site of ICAM-1 promoter after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation .,activates;expression;binding;after;activation;,6;9;18;28;32;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Binding;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" However , CTLA-4 ligation did not appear to affect the CD28 - mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA .",ligation;affect;mediated;stabilization;,4;9;13;14;,Binding;Regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Further , CTLA-4 engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of cyclin D3 , cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4 , and cdk6 when the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and with anti-CD3 alone .",engagement;inhibiting;production;when;,4;12;14;25;,Binding;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" These results indicate that CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2 - independent events of the cell cycle , and does not simply oppose CD28 - mediated costimulation .",inhibits;transcription;,7;17;,Negative_regulation;Transcription;
 Fibroblast growth factor-1 ( FGF-1 ) enhances IL-2 production and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in FGF receptor-bearing Jurkat T cells .,enhances;production;,7;9;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) are heparin-binding proteins crucial to embryogenesis , angiogenesis , and wound healing .",,,
" FGF-1 is abundantly expressed in the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis and in rejecting allografts , sites of chronic immune-mediated inflammation .",expressed;,4;,Gene_expression;
" The frequency of FGF-1 - responsive T cells is increased in the peripheral blood of these disorders , and a high percentage of infiltrating T cells in rheumatoid arthritis synovium express receptors for FGF-1 .",,,
" To understand the action of FGF-1 in T cells , studies were initiated in Jurkat T cells that express the signaling isoform of FGF receptor-1 .",express;,19;,Gene_expression;
 These experiments show that FGF-1 stimulation of Jurkat T cells provides a second signal that augments TCR - mediated IL-2 production .,provides;augments;mediated;production;,11;16;19;21;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Analogous to costimulation via CD28 , this activity is mediated through activation of Rel/kappaB , a family of transcription factors known to regulate IL-2 and other activation-inducible proteins .",mediated;regulate;,10;23;,Positive_regulation;Regulation;
" FGF-1 alone induces modest nuclear translocation of kappaB-binding proteins , and this translocation is enhanced by the combination of anti-CD3 and FGF-1 .",,,
" This NF-kappaB binding complex is composed of transcriptionally active p65 ( RelA )/ p50 heterodimers and results primarily from the targeted degradation of IkappaB-alpha , an inhibitor that sequesters Rel/kappaB in the cytoplasm .",composed;results;degradation;,6;17;22;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Protein_catabolism;
 These data are the first to show a connection between FGF-1 signaling and NF-kappaB activation outside of embryonic development .,,,
" The signaling events that link FGF receptor-1 engagement and NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat are probably distinct from the CD28 costimulation pathway , since FGF-1 - induced Rel/kappaB binding proteins do not contain significant levels of c-Rel and are not identical with the CD28 response complex .",engagement;induced;,8;26;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
 Signaling through the lymphotoxin-beta receptor stimulates HIV-1 replication alone and in cooperation with soluble or membrane-bound TNF-alpha .,,,
 The level of ongoing HIV-1 replication within an individual is critical to HIV-1 pathogenesis .,,,
" Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF-alpha has previously been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems .",,,
" Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the TNF receptor family member , the lymphotoxin-beta ( LT-beta ) receptor ( LT-betaR ) , also regulates HIV-1 replication .",,,
" Furthermore , HIV-1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT-betaR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands .",,,
" Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that membrane-bound TNF-alpha and LT-alpha1beta2 act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV-1 replication .",,,
" Thus , cosignaling via the LT-beta and TNF-alpha receptors is probably involved in the modulation of HIV-1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV-1 viral burden in monocytes .",,,
" Intriguingly , surface expression of LT-alpha1beta2 is up-regulated on a T cell line acutely infected with HIV-1 , suggesting a positive feedback loop between HIV-1 infection , LT-alpha1beta2 expression , and HIV-1 replication .",,,
" Given the critical role that LT-alpha1beta2 plays in lymphoid architecture , we speculate that LT-alpha1beta2 may be involved in HIV-associated abnormalities of the lymphoid organs .",,,
 Resistance to tumor necrosis factor induced apoptosis in vitro correlates with high metastatic capacity of cells in vivo .,,,
 TNF is one of the cytokines secreted by the cells of the immune system .,,,
 Our data demonstrate that those cell lines lacking capability to form metastatic tumors in vivo are susceptible to TNF induced apoptosis in vitro .,,,
" However , cell lines with high metastatic potential are resistant to TNF in vitro .",,,
" Furthermore , the same cell lines were resistant to cytolytic action of other cytotoxic proteins secreted by LAK cells .",,,
 Our data showed that TNF resistance in vitro correlates with the increased level of transcription factor NF-kappaB .,,,
 This finding may provide a tool to improve current protocols of immunotherapy and insights to how tumor cells are or are not killed by LAK cells .,,,
 NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a - induced interleukin-8 gene expression in mononuclear cells .,induced;expression;,8;11;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" C5a , a potent peptide chemoattractant , stimulates interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .",stimulates;secretion;,8;13;,Positive_regulation;Localization;

 IL-8 secretion was accompanied by accumulation of IL-8 mRNA in the cytosol and by nuclear expression of a kappaB DNA binding activity within 30 minutes .,secretion;,2;,Localization;
" AP-1 but not NF-IL-6 DNA binding activity was also detected in C5a-stimulated PBMC ; however , its delayed expression ( maximal at 4 hours ) suggested a less important role in the rapid production of IL-8 .",binding;detected;role;production;,6;10;30;34;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Regulation;Gene_expression;
 The correlation between C5a-induced kappaB binding activity and IL-8 gene expression was examined in the RAW264.7 macrophage cells using reporter genes directed by the kappaB sequence from IkappaBalpha and IL-8 promoter regions .,expression;,11;,Gene_expression;
 C5a-induced reporter gene expression was abolished by introducing mutations into the kappaB sites and by coexpression of a dominant negative IkappaBalpha construct resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation .,coexpression;,16;,Gene_expression;
" Pertussis toxin , which ADP-ribosylates the Gi proteins known to couple to the C5a receptor , produced minimal inhibition of C5a - induced IL-8 expression and had little effect on C5a-induced calcium mobilization in RAW264.7 cells .",couple;inhibition;induced;expression;,11;19;23;25;,Binding;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 These results suggest that NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a - induced IL-8 gene expression and that this response is mediated primarily through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway .,induced;expression;,12;15;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Transcriptional targeting of retroviral vectors to the erythroblastic progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .,,,
" Targeted expression to specific tissues or cell lineages is a necessary feature of a gene therapy vector for many clinical applications , such as correction of hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells .",,,
 We developed retroviral vectors in which the constitutive viral enhancer in the U3 region of the 3' LTR is replaced by an autoregulatory enhancer of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene .,,,
 The replaced enhancer is propagated to the 5' LTR upon integration into the target cell genome .,,,
" The modified vectors were used to transduce human hematopoietic cell lines , cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells , and murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells .",,,
" The expression of appropriate reporter genes ( triangle upLNGFR , EGFP ) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of transduced stem cells in vitro , in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay , and in vivo , after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 The GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer effectively restricts the expression of the LTR-driven proviral transcription unit to the erythroblastic progeny of both human progenitors and mouse-repopulating stem cells .,,,
" Packaging of viral particles , integration into the target genome , and stability of the integrated provirus are not affected by the LTR modification .",,,
 Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a retroviral transgene to a specific progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .,,,
 An essential role for NF-kappaB in human CD34 (+) bone marrow cell survival .,,,
" The transcription factor , NF-kappaB , is important for T-cell activation , B-cell maturation , and human immunodeficiency virus transcription and plays a role in alternatively mediating and protecting against apoptosis in a variety of cell types .",,,
" However , a role for NF-kappaB in human CD34 (+) bone marrow cells has not been described .",,,
" We provide evidence here that virtually all human CD34 (+) bone marrow cells express NF-kappaB that can be activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a variety of cytokines , eg , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin-3 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor .",express;,14;,Gene_expression;
" In addition , we demonstrate that NF-kappaB may be required for human CD34 (+) bone marrow cell clonogenic function and survival .",,,
 These results offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB in maintaining survival and function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and suggest that proposed strategies involving inhibition of NF-kappaB activation as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy should be approached with caution .,,,
 Unicellular-unilineage erythropoietic cultures : molecular analysis of regulatory gene expression at sibling cell level .,,,
" In vitro studies on hematopoietic control mechanisms have been hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed cell populations , ie , lack of lineage specificity and developmental stage homogeneity of progenitor/precursor cells growing in culture .",,,
 We developed unicellular culture systems for unilineage differentiation of purified hematopoietic progenitor cells followed by daughter cell analysis at cellular and molecular level .,,,
" In the culture system reported here , ( 1 ) the growth factor ( GF ) stimulus induces cord blood ( CB ) progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate/mature exclusively along the erythroid lineage ; ( 2 ) this erythropoietic wave is characterized by less than 4 % apoptotic cells ; ( 3 ) asymmetric divisions are virtually absent , ie , nonresponsive hematopoietic progenitors with no erythropoietic potential are forced into apoptosis ; ( 4 ) the system is cell division controlled ( cdc ) , ie , the number of divisions performed by each cell is monitored .",,,
" Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was applied to this culture system to investigate gene expression of diverse receptors , markers of differentiation , and transcription factors ( EKLF , GATA-1 , GATA-2 , p45 NF-E2 , PU.1 , and SCL / Tal1 ) at discrete stages of erythropoietic development .",,,
" Freshly isolated CD34 (+) cells expressed CD34 , c-kit , PU.1 , and GATA-2 but did not express CD36 , erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) , SCL / Tal1 , EKLF , NF-E2 , GATA-1 , or glyocophorin A ( GPA ) .",expressed;express;,6;18;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" In early to intermediate stages of erythroid differentiation we monitored the induction of CD36 , Tal1 , EKLF , NF-E2 , and GATA-1 that preceeded expression of EpoR .",induction;expression;,12;26;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" In late stages of erythroid maturation , GPA was upregulated , whereas CD34 , c-kit , PU.1 , and GATA-2 were barely or not detected .",upregulated;detected;,10;25;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" In addition , competitive single-cell RT-PCR was used to assay CD34 mRNA transcripts in sibling CD34 (+) CD38 (-) cells differentiating in unilineage erythroid cultures : this analysis allowed us to semiquantitate the gradual downmodulation of CD34 mRNA from progenitor cells through their differentiating erythroid progeny .",downmodulation;,35;,Negative_regulation;
" It is concluded that this novel culture system , coupled with single-cell RT-PCR analysis , may eliminate the ambiguities intrinsic to molecular studies on heterogeneous populations of hematopoietic progenitors/precursors growing in culture , particularly in the initial stages of development .",,,
 Control of cell cycle entry and apoptosis in B lymphocytes infected by Epstein-Barr virus .,,,
 Infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in activation of the cell cycle and cell growth .,,,
" To interpret the mechanisms by which EBV activates the cell , we have assayed many proteins involved in control of the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle and regulation of apoptosis .",,,
" In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of cyclin D2 , are dependent on expression of EBV genes , but an alteration in the E2F-4 profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , presumably occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , CD21 .",induction;dependent;alteration;independent;occurring;binds;,12;18;27;34;41;51;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Regulation;Regulation;Positive_regulation;Binding;
" By comparing the expression of genes controlling apoptosis , including those encoding several members of the BCL-2 family of proteins , the known relative resistance of EBV-immortalized B-cell lines to apoptosis induced by low serum was found to correlate with expression of both BCL-2 and A20 .",expression;expression;,4;41;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" A20 can be regulated by the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which is known to be activated by the EBV LMP-1 protein .",regulated;,4;,Regulation;
 Quantitative assays demonstrated a direct temporal relationship between LMP-1 protein levels and active NF-kappaB during the time course of infection .,,,
 Immortalization of CD4 (+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax mutants expressed in a functional molecular clone .,expressed;,18;,Gene_expression;
 The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcriptional trans-activator Tax has been demonstrated to have transforming activity in multiple cell culture and transgenic-mouse models .,,,
" In addition to activating transcription from the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) through the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family of transcription factors , Tax activates the expression of multiple cellular promoters through the NF-kappaB pathway of transcriptional activation .",,,
" The Tax mutants M22 and M47 have previously been demonstrated to selectively abrogate the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the NF-kappaB or CREB/ATF pathway , respectively .",,,
" These mutations were introduced in the tax gene of the ACH functional molecular clone of HTLV-1 , and virus produced from the mutant ACH clones was examined for the ability to replicate and immortalize primary human lymphocytes .",,,
" While virus derived from the clone containing the M47 mutation retained the ability to immortalize T lymphocytes , the M22 mutant lost the ability to immortalize infected cells .",,,
" These results indicate that activation of the CREB/ATF pathway by Tax is dispensable for the immortalization of T cells by HTLV-1 , whereas activation of the NF-kappaB pathway may be critical .",,,
 HIV-1 reactivation in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected adults upon in vitro CD4 cross-linking by ligands of the CDR2-loop in extracellular domain 1 .,cross-linking;,16;,Binding;
 HIV-1 infects resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) but remains inactive state until subsequent cell activation .,,,
 We have demonstrated that the cross-linking of cell surface CD4 by gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes or heat-inactivated HIV-1 ( iHIV-1 ) is sufficient to trigger activation signals leading to virus reactivation ( 9 ) .,cross-linking;,6;,Binding;
" In this study , we demonstrate that NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and stimulation of virus production by iHIV-1 were strictly linked to the concentrations of viral proteins used as exogenous stimuli .",,,
" Moreover , we further investigated the physiologic relevance of these observations .",,,
" When submitted to an in vitro CD4 cross-linking by iHIV-1 , PBMCs from HIV-1-infected patients were found to produce virus .",cross-linking;,8;,Binding;
 This viral reactivation was associated with increased NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in patients ' PBMCs .,,,
" Additionally , virus reactivation in resting PBMCs infected in vitro with HIV-1 was found to be specifically induced by ligands of the CDR2-loop in domain 1 ( D1 ) of CD4 ( virus envelope and anti - CD4 monoclonal antibodies ) .",,,
" In contrast , virus reactivation was not observed following CD4 oligomerization by antibodies that bind other epitopes in D1 , including the D1/CDR3-loop .",oligomerization;,11;,Binding;
" Finally , soluble CD4 ( sCD4 ) prevented virus reactivation by D1/CDR2-loop ligands .",,,
 Our results indicate that the signaling events initiated in PBMCs by oligomerization of CD4 at the D1/CDR2-loop can trigger HIV-1 upregulation in infected individuals .,oligomerization;,12;,Binding;
 Defining therapeutic targets by using adenovirus : blocking NF-kappaB inhibits both inflammatory and destructive mechanisms in rheumatoid synovium but spares anti-inflammatory mediators .,,,
 The role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis has long been a subject of controversy .,,,
" We used an adenoviral technique of blocking NF-kappaB through overexpression of the inhibitory subunit IkappaBalpha , which has the advantage that it can be used in the diseased tissue itself , with > 90 % of the synovial macrophages , fibroblasts , and T cells infected .",overexpression;,10;,Negative_regulation;
" We found that the spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines is NF-kappaB - dependent in rheumatoid synovial tissue , in contrast to the main anti-inflammatory mediators , like IL-10 and -11 , and the IL-1 receptor antagonist .",production;dependent;,6;19;,Gene_expression;Regulation;

" Blocking NF-kappaB in the rheumatoid joint thus has a very beneficial profile , reducing both the inflammatory response and the tissue destruction .",,,

 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the expression of cytokines and induce HSP70 in human monocytes .,,,

" As HSF1 can function as both an activator of heat shock genes and a repressor of non-heat shock genes such as IL1B and c- fos , we have examined the potential role of HSF1 in the effects of NSAIDs on gene expression in a human monocytic cell line THP-1 .",activator;repressor;,8;15;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;

 Disruption of alpha beta but not of gamma delta T cell development by overexpression of the helix-loop-helix protein Id3 in committed T cell progenitors .,overexpression;,14;,Gene_expression;
" Enforced expression of Id3 , which has the capacity to inhibit many basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors , in human CD34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells that have not undergone T cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangements inhibits development of the transduced cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .",Enforced;expression;,1;2;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 We also observed that cell surface CD4 (-)CD8(-)CD3(-) cells with rearranged TCR genes developed from Id3 - transduced but not from control-transduced pre-T cells in an FTOC .,,,

 Regulation of low shear flow - induced HAEC VCAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion .,Regulation;induced;expression;,1;7;10;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 We recently reported that prolonged exposure of human aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC ) to low shear stress flow patterns is associated with a sustained increase in the activated form of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) .,,,
 Here we investigate the hypothesis that low shear-induced activation of NF-kappaB is responsible for enhanced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM-1 ) resulting in augmented endothelial cell-monocyte ( EC-Mn ) adhesion and that this activation is dependent on intracellular oxidant activity .,expression;,16;,Gene_expression;
" Before exposure to low shear ( 2 dyn/cm2 ) for 6 h , HAEC were preincubated with or without the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) .",,,
" PDTC strongly inhibited low shear - induced activation of NF-kappaB , expression of VCAM-1 , and EC-Mn adhesion .",inhibited;induced;expression;,3;7;12;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Paradoxically , NAC exerted a positive effect on low shear - induced VCAM-1 expression and EC-Mn adhesion and only slightly downregulated NF-kappaB activation .",induced;expression;,12;14;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" However , cytokine - induced NF-kappaB activation and VCAM-1 expression are blocked by both PDTC and NAC .",induced;expression;blocked;,5;10;12;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
 These data suggest that NF-kappaB plays a key role in low shear - induced VCAM-1 expression and that pathways mediating low shear- and cytokine-induced EC-Mn adhesion may be differentially regulated .,induced;expression;,14;16;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Nuclear localization and formation of beta-catenin - lymphoid enhancer factor 1 complexes are not sufficient for activation of gene expression .,localization;complexes;,2;12;,Localization;Binding;
" In response to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway , beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus , where it cooperates with LEF/TCF ( for lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor ) transcription factors to activate gene expression .",accumulates;,12;,Localization;
 The mechanisms by which beta-catenin undergoes this shift in location and participates in activation of gene transcription are unknown .,undergoes;,6;,Positive_regulation;
" We demonstrate here that beta-catenin can be imported into the nucleus independently of LEF/TCF binding , and it may also be exported from nuclei .",imported;binding;exported;,8;15;22;,Localization;Binding;Localization;
" We have introduced a small deletion within beta-catenin ( Delta19 ) that disrupts binding to LEF-1 , E-cadherin , and APC but not axin .",disrupts;binding;,13;14;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
 This Delta19 beta-catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm .,,,
 The nuclear localization of Delta19 definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which beta-catenin localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of LEF/TCF factors .,localizes;,14;,Localization;
" beta-Catenin and LEF-1 complexes can activate reporter gene expression in a transformed T-lymphocyte cell line ( Jurkat ) but not in normal T lymphocytes , even though both factors are nuclear .",are;,30;,Localization;

 Paradoxical priming effects of IL-10 on cytokine production .,,,
 IL-10 is a well-known immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory cytokine .,,,
" However , we report in vitro experimental studies in which IL-10 primed leukocytes and led to an enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) upon further stimulation by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .",production;upon;,19;27;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

" When isolated PBMC were first cultured for 20 h in the presence of IL-10 on Teflon to prevent adherence , washed to remove IL-10 and then further cultured in plastic dishes for an additional 20 h in the presence of LPS or IL-1beta , an enhanced release of TNF was observed .",enhanced;release;,46;47;,Positive_regulation;Localization;
 This was not the case when PBMC were pre-cultured in plastic multidishes in the presence of IL-10 .,not;,3;,Positive_regulation;
" TNF mRNA expression induced by LPS was decreased when the pre-treatment of PBMC with IL-10 was performed on plastic , whereas this was not the case when cells were pre-cultured with IL-10 on Teflon .",,,
" Furthermore , NFkappaB translocation following LPS activation was higher after IL-10 pre-treatment on Teflon than on plastic .",,,
" Interestingly , an enhanced frequency of CD16 and CD68 (+) cells among the CD14 (+) cells was observed in the presence of IL-10 , independently of the pre-culture conditions of the PBMC .",,,
" Altogether , these results indicate that the IL-10 - induced up-regulation of cytokine production depends on the prevention of monocyte adherence by red cells in the whole blood assays or by cultures of PBMC on Teflon .",,,
" In contrast , the adherence parameter has no effect on the IL-10 - induced modulation of some monocyte surface markers .",,,
 Different sequence requirements for expression in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells within a regulatory element upstream of the GATA-1 gene .,requirements;expression;,3;5;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 The lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 is required for differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells .,,,

 Comparative sequence analysis of HS I between human and mouse shows approx .,,,
 63 % nucleotide identity with a more conserved core of 169 base pairs ( 86 % identity ) .,,,
 This core contains a GATA site separated by 10 base pairs from an E-box motif .,,,
" The composite motif binds a multi-protein hematopoietic-specific transcription factor complex which includes GATA-1 , SCL / tal-1 , E2A , Lmo2 and Ldb-1 .",binds;,4;,Binding;
" Point mutations of the GATA site abolishes HS I function , whereas mutation of the E-box motif still allows reporter gene expression in both lineages .",,,
" Strict dependence of HS I activity on a GATA site implies that assembly of a protein complex containing a GATA-factor , presumably GATA-1 or GATA-2 , is critical to activating or maintaining its function .",,,
" Further dissection of the 317 base pair region demonstrates that , whereas all 317 base pairs are required for expression in megakaryocytes , only the 5' 62 base pairs are needed for erythroid-specific reporter expression .",,,
 These findings demonstrate differential lineage requirements for expression within the HS I element .,,,
 Monocyte arrest and transmigration on inflamed endothelium in shear flow is inhibited by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of IkappaB-alpha .,,,

" Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha - activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression .",overexpression;,29;,Positive_regulation;
 Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .,,,

" SLP-76 and Vav , two hematopoietic cell specific molecules , are critical for T cell development and activation .",,,

" Surprisingly , we find also that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity , as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression .",interaction;required;augmenting;upstream;,8;15;20;36;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Overexpression of SLP-76 in the Jurkat T cell line potentiates the activities of both nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 transcription factors .,Overexpression;,1;,Gene_expression;

 Targeted remodeling of human beta-globin promoter chromatin structure produces increased expression and decreased silencing .,increased;expression;,10;11;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 The chromatin structure of the human beta-globin gene locus assumes a transcriptionally-active conformation in erythroid cells .,transcriptionally-active;,12;,Transcription;
 One feature of this chromatin reorganization is the formation of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in the regions of active globin gene promoters .,,,
 This reorganization requires the globin locus control region and is associated with normal expression of the beta-like globin genes .,,,
" To determine whether it is possible to artificially enhance the opening of the chromatin structure of a minimal beta-globin promoter , we placed a 101bp , erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitive site-forming element ( HSFE ) immediately upstream of the beta-globin promoter and gene .",,,
" This element includes binding sites for NF-E2 , AP-1 , GATA-1 and Sp-1 .",,,
 Constructs were stably transfected into murine erythroleukemia cells and promoter chromatin structure and gene expression were analyzed .,,,
 The HSFE induced an area of enhanced DNase 1 hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to -300bp of the artificial promoter and significantly increased the proportion of beta-globin promoters in an open chromatin configuration .,,,
" This remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulted in 3-fold increases in beta-globin gene transcription and induction , and inhibited long-term beta-globin gene silencing .",increases;transcription;induction;,10;14;16;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;Positive_regulation;

" Transgene expression did not affect the thymic development , but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was not attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes .,expression;abnormal;expression;,7;21;22;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;

 The proliferative deficiency of the transgenic T cells was associated with an increased apoptosis .,,,
 These results point out the involvement of NF-kappa B/Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by either regulating proteins involved in the IL-2 signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression .,,,

 Repression by Ikaros and Aiolos is mediated through histone deacetylase complexes .,,,
 Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors .,,,
 This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type .,,,
 Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors .,,,

 Human alveolar macrophages are markedly deficient in REF-1 and AP-1 DNA binding activity .,deficient;,6;,Negative_regulation;
" Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell , the blood monocyte ( monocyte ) , the reason(s) for these functional changes have not been determined .",,,

" To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity , we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex .",,,
" There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein , REF-1 ( which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins ) , in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .",,,

 The intracellular parasite Theileria parva protects infected T cells from apoptosis .,,,
 Parasites have evolved a plethora of strategies to ensure their survival .,,,
" The intracellular parasite Theileria parva secures its propagation and spreads through the infected animal by infecting and transforming T cells , inducing their continuous proliferation and rendering them metastatic .",,,
" In previous work , we have shown that the parasite induces constitutive activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB , by inducing the constitutive degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitors .",,,
" The biological significance of NF-kappaB activation in T. parva-infected cells , however , has not yet been defined .",,,
 Cells that have been transformed by viruses or oncogenes can persist only if they manage to avoid destruction by the apoptotic mechanisms that are activated on transformation and that contribute to maintain cellular homeostasis .,,,
 We now demonstrate that parasite-induced NF-kappaB activation plays a crucial role in the survival of T. parva-transformed T cells by conveying protection against an apoptotic signal that accompanies parasite-mediated transformation .,,,
" Consequently , inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and the expression of dominant negative mutant forms of components of the NF-kappaB activation pathway , such as IkappaBalpha or p65 , prompt rapid apoptosis of T. parva-transformed T cells .",,,
 Our findings offer important insights into parasite survival strategies and demonstrate that parasite-induced constitutive NF-kappaB activation is an essential step in maintaining the transformed phenotype of the infected cells .,,,

 The transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for normal erythropoiesis .,,,
" By examining in vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells , we showed previously that in the absence of GATA-1 , committed erythroid precursors fail to complete maturation and instead undergo apoptosis .",,,
 The mechanisms by which GATA-1 controls cell survival are unknown .,,,

" Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1 - induced erythroid cell survival , in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL -/- embryonic stem cells fail to generate viable mature definitive erythroid cells , a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption .",,,

" Conversely , inhibition of NF-kappaB confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis , establishing that NF-kappaB also functions as an antiapoptotic factor .",,,
 We conclude that NF-kappaB is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator .,,,
 Our data suggests that NF-kappaB may function as an antiapoptotic factor in thymocytes while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in mature peripheral T cells .,,,

 Distinctive gene expression patterns in human mammary epithelial cells and breast cancers .,,,
 cDNA microarrays and a clustering algorithm were used to identify patterns of gene expression in human mammary epithelial cells growing in culture and in primary human breast tumors .,,,
 Clusters of coexpressed genes identified through manipulations of mammary epithelial cells in vitro also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor samples .,,,
" By using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against proteins encoded by a particular gene in a cluster , the identity of the cell type within the tumor specimen that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be determined .",,,

 Further analysis of the MBP promoter region identified a C/EBP ( CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ) consensus binding site 6 bp upstream of the functional GATA-binding site in the MBP gene .,,,
" In the cell line HT93A , which is capable of differentiating towards both the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages in response to retinoic acid ( RA ) , C/EBPalpha mRNA expression decreased significantly concomitant with eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation , whereas C/EBPbeta expression was markedly increased .",expression;decreased;expression;increased;,30;31;42;45;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

 Thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interaction leads to high-level replication of human immunodeficiency virus exclusively in mature CD4 (+) CD8(-) CD3(+) thymocytes : a critical role for tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-7 .,,,
 This work aims at identifying the thymocyte subpopulation able to support human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication under the biological stimuli of the thymic microenvironment .,,,
 In this report we demonstrate that interaction with thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) induces a high-level replication of the T-tropic primary isolate HIV-1(B-LAIp) exclusively in the mature CD4 (+) CD8(-) CD3(+) thymocytes .,,,
" Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) , secreted during this interaction , are critical cytokines for HIV long terminal repeat transactivation through NF-kappaB-dependent activation .",secreted;,13;,Localization;

 The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4 (+) CD8(-) CD3(-) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates with the absence of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes .,production;,33;,Gene_expression;
 Addition of exogenous TNF to the intermediate thymocyte cultures induces NF-kappaB activity and is sufficient to promote HIV replication in the cocultures with TEC .,,,
" The other major subpopulation expressing the CD4 receptor , namely , the double-positive ( DP ) CD4 (+) CD8(+) CD3(+/-) thymocytes , despite the entry of the virus , do not produce a significant level of virus , presumably because they are unresponsive to TNF and IL-7 .",expressing;,5;,Gene_expression;
" Together , these data suggest that in vivo , despite an efficient entry of the virus in all the CD4 (+) subpopulations , a high viral load may be generated exclusively within the mature CD4 (+) CD8(-) CD3(+) subset of thymocytes .",,,

 IL-2 - independent activation and proliferation in human T cells induced by CD28 .,,,
" Although the role of CD28 in T cell costimulation is firmly established , the mechanisms by which it exerts its costimulatory actions are less clear .",,,
" In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of CD28 from subsequent actions of cytokines , such as IL-2 , on T cell proliferation .",,,

" Promoter assays revealed CD28 - dependent effects on both NF-kappaB and AP-1 , but not on NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter .",effects;,7;,Regulation;
" In addition , T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .",,,
" Moreover T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking Abs to both IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , demonstrating that this form of costimulation by CD28 was independent of IL-2 .",blocking;,11;,Negative_regulation;
 We also investigated the effects of stimulating T cell blasts with CD80 alone and found that there was a limited requirement for IL-2 in this system .,,,

 Suppression of TNFalpha - mediated NFkappaB activity by myricetin and other flavonoids through downregulating the activity of IKK in ECV304 cells .,,,
" Flavonoids are a group of naturally-occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom , and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties .",,,
 Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized .,,,
" In view of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis , prevention of the activation of NFkappaB represents an important role in protecting vascular injury .",,,
" In this study , the effects of flavonoids on NFkappaB/inhibitor-kappaB ( IkappaB ) system in ECV304 cells activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) were examined .",,,
" We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) activity , an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation .",,,
" Of six flavonoids tested , myricetin was found to strongly inhibit IKK kinase activity , and prevent the degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in activated endothelial cells .",prevent;degradation;,17;19;,Negative_regulation;Protein_catabolism;
" Furthermore , myricetin was also found to inhibit NFkappaB activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to ECV304 cells .",,,

 Induction of a functional vitamin D receptor in all-trans-retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation of M2-type leukemic blast cells .,Induction;,1;,Positive_regulation;
 Different types of acute myeloid leukemia blast cells were induced to differentiate in vitro with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and vitamin D3 ( VD ) .,,,
" M0/M1 leukemic cells are not sensitive to differentiating agents , whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are not sensitive to VD .",,,
 M2 leukemic blast cells behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers .,,,
" To gain some insight into the maturation of M2-type leukemic cells , we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous M2 blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 cells ( an acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line ) .",,,

 Dopamine stimulates expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 via NF-kappaB in cells of the immune system .,,,
" Recent studies have reported that lymphocytes produce , transport and bind dopamine present in plasma .",,,
" However , the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has not yet been examined .",,,
" Here , we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in Jurkat T cells and in primary blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .",,,
" HIV-1 replication was increased by dopamine , which correlated with the increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation .",,,
 Our transient expression data revealed that dopamine stimulated transcription through the NF-kappaB element present in the long terminal repeat .,,,
 The importance of NF-kappaB sites was confirmed by using vectors containing wild-type or mutant kappaB sites in a heterologous promoter .,,,
" Consistent with the role of NF-kappaB in mediating dopamine responsiveness , the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished dopamine-induced transcriptional activation .",,,
 We further explored the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters or tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) known to activate NF-kappaB .,,,
 The combination of dopamine and TNF-alpha led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication .,,,

 c-Maf induces monocytic differentiation and apoptosis in bipotent myeloid progenitors .,,,
 The transcriptional mechanisms that drive colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM ) myeloid progenitors to differentiate into cells of either the granulocytic or monocytic lineage are not fully understood .,,,
 We have shown that the c-Maf and c-Myb transcription factors physically interact in myeloid cells to form inhibitory complexes that hinder transactivation of c-Myb target genes through direct binding to Myb consensus sites .,,,
" These complexes arise in a developmentally regulated pattern , peaking at the promyelocyte stage , or in cell model systems , appearing soon after the induction of monocytic differentiation .",,,
 We wished to determine if this developmentally related interaction is a consequence of myeloid differentiation or an intrinsic differentiating stimulus .,,,

 Pretreatment ( or up to 15 minutes posttreatment ) relative to TNFalpha with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( 2 % [ vol/vol ] ) blocks 80 % of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription .,,,

" Similar selective effects on NF-kappaB transcription are seen with the unrelated antioxidants , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) and vitamin C .",,,
 These data indicate that TNFalpha induces a delayed ROS-dependent signalling pathway that is required for NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation .,,,
 Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by TNFalpha signalling .,,,
 Neutrophil maturation and the role of retinoic acid .,,,
 Neutrophil maturation occurs in well defined morphological stages that correlate with the acquisition of molecular markers associated with neutrophil function .,,,
" A variety of factors are known to play a role in terminal neutrophil maturation , including the vitamin A derivative , retinoic acid .",,,
" Retinoic acid can directly modulate gene expression via binding to its nuclear receptors , which can , in turn , activate transcription of target genes .",,,
 A role for retinoic acid during neutrophil maturation has been suggested from a variety of sources .,,,
 Here we present a review of the mechanism of retinoic acid receptor action and the major evidence showing that normal retinoid signaling is required for neutrophil maturation .,,,

 Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax is thought to play a pivotal role in immortalization of T cells .,,,

 Increased IkappaB expression and diminished nuclear NF-kappaB in human mononuclear cells following hydrocortisone injection .,,,
 We have recently demonstrated that hydrocortisone and other glucocorticoids inhibit reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation by mononuclear ( MNC ) and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ( PMNL ) .,,,
" Since NF-kappaB/IkappaB system regulates the transcription of proinflammatory genes , including those responsible for ROS generation , we tested the hypothesis that hydrocortisone may stimulate IkappaB production thus inhibiting NF-kappaB translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus in MNC , in vivo .",,,
 One hundred milligram of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously into 4 normal subjects .,,,
" Blood samples were obtained prior to the injection and at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 24 hr after the injection .",,,
 Nuclear extracts and total cell lysates were prepared from MNC by standard techniques .,,,

" NF-kappaB in MNC nuclear extracts decreased at 1 hr , reached a nadir at 4 hr , gradually increased at 8 hr and returned back to baseline levels at 24 hr .",,,

 ROS generation inhibition paralleled NF-kappaB levels in the nucleus .,,,

 Our data demonstrate that hydrocortisone induces IkappaB and suppresses NF-kappaB expression in MNC in parallel .,,,
 IkappaB further reduces the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus thus preventing the expression of proinflammatory genes .,,,
 Renal cell carcinoma-derived gangliosides suppress nuclear factor-kappaB activation in T cells .,,,
 Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) is impaired in T cells from patients with renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ) .,,,

 Affinity-driven peptide selection of an NFAT inhibitor more selective than cyclosporin A [ see comments ],,,
 The flow of information from calcium-mobilizing receptors to nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) -dependent genes is critically dependent on interaction between the phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFAT .,,,
 A high-affinity calcineurin-binding peptide was selected from combinatorial peptide libraries based on the calcineurin docking motif of NFAT .,,,
" This peptide potently inhibited NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent expression of endogenous cytokine genes in T cells , without affecting the expression of other cytokines that require calcineurin but not NFAT .",,,
 Substitution of the optimized peptide sequence into the natural calcineurin docking site increased the calcineurin responsiveness of NFAT .,,,
 Compounds that interfere selectively with the calcineurin-NFAT interaction without affecting calcineurin phosphatase activity may be useful as therapeutic agents that are less toxic than current drugs .,,,

 The development of functionally responsive T cells .,,,
 The work reviewed in this article separates T cell development into four phases .,,,
" First is an expansion phase prior to TCR rearrangement , which appears to be correlated with programming of at least some response genes for inducibility .",,,
 This phase can occur to some extent outside of the thymus .,,,
" However , the profound T cell deficit of nude mice indicates that the thymus is by far the most potent site for inducing the expansion per se , even if other sites can induce some response acquisition .",,,
 Second is a controlled phase of TCR gene rearrangement .,,,
 The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular loci for rearrangement are still not known .,,,
" It seems that the rearrangement of the TCR gamma loci in the gamma delta lineage may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of TCR beta in the alpha beta lineage , and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge .",,,
" In the TCR alpha beta lineage , however , the final gene rearrangement events are accompanied by rapid proliferation and an interruption in cellular response gene inducibility .",,,
" The loss of conventional responsiveness is probably caused by alterations at the level of signaling , and may be a manifestation of the physiological state that is a precondition for selection .",,,
 Third is the complex process of selection .,,,
" Whereas peripheral T cells can undergo forms of positive selection ( by antigen-driven clonal expansion ) and negative selection ( by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death ) , neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex .",,,
" Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness : instead of turning on IL-2 expression , the activated cell destroys its own chromatin .",inversion;responsiveness;turning;expression;,11;14;18;21;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),,,
 Activation of NF-kappa B by interleukin 2 in human blood monocytes .,,,
 We report here that interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain ( p55 ) .,enhancing;,16;,Positive_regulation;
" Similarly , IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937 , but not in resting human T-cells .",,,
 This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2 .,,,
 Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence ( -291 to -245 ) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated .,inducibility;mediated;activated;,13;21;51;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements .,,,
 A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -95 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site .,,,
" Within this region , single AP-2- and AP-1- like consensus sequences were noted .",,,
 These AP-2 and AP-1 sites were each modified with a double point mutation .,,,
 A modest ( 20-50 % ) reduction in TNF promoter activity was observed with the AP-2 site mutation .,reduction;,7;,Negative_regulation;

 Redox status of cells influences constitutive or induced NF-kappa B translocation and HIV long terminal repeat activity in human T and monocytic cell lines .,,,
 We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in T lymphocytes and monocytes and mediated through translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells .,,,
" We used phenolic , lipid-soluble , chain-breaking antioxidants ( butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , nordihydroquairetic acid , or alpha-tocopherol ( vitamin E ) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells blocks the functions depending on NF-kappa B activation .",,,
" BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced , but also constitutive , HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T ( J.Jhan ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines .",,,
 This was also true for KBF ( p50 homodimer ) binding activity in U937 cells .,,,
" Secretion of TNF , the product of another NF-kappa B-dependent gene , was abolished by BHA in PMA-stimulated U937 cells .",,,
" The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol , but not glutathione , content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell , whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level .",,,
 Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status .,,,
" Rather , TNF and PMA can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status , because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation .",,,
 It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of NF-kappa B-dependent genes .,,,
 Natural variants of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat : analysis of promoters with duplicated DNA regulatory motifs .,,,
 Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals .,,,
 Two classes of LTR size variants were found .,,,
 One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 .,,,
 Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer .,,,
 This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence ( CTG-motif ) .,,,
 Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites .,,,
 No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected .,,,
" In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately , equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells .",,,
 The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days .,,,
 Based on these results we estimate a 5-10 % difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type .,,,
 Transcription of the hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer in erythroid cells .,,,
" In the human genome , the erythroid-specific hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer regulates the transcription of the downstream beta-like globin genes 10-50 kilobases away .",regulates;transcription;,12;14;,Regulation;Transcription;
 The mechanism of HS2 enhancer function is not known .,,,
 The present study employs RNA protection assays to analyze the transcriptional status of the HS2 enhancer in transfected recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids .,,,
" In erythroid K562 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is active , the HS2 sequence directs the synthesis of long enhancer transcripts that are initiated apparently from within the enhancer and elongated through the intervening DNA into the cis-linked CAT gene .",,,
" In nonerythroid HL-60 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is inactive , long enhancer transcripts are not detectable .",,,
 Splitting the HS2 enhancer between two tandem Ap1 sites abolishes the synthesis of a group of long enhancer transcripts and results in loss of enhancer function and transcriptional silencing of the cis-linked CAT gene .,,,
" In directing the synthesis of RNA through the intervening DNA and the gene by a tracking and transcription mechanism , the HS2 enhancer may ( i ) open up the chromatin structure of a gene domain and ( ii ) deliver enhancer binding proteins to the promoter sequence where they may stimulate the transcription of the gene at the cap site .",,,
 Phorbol ester reduces constitutive nuclear NF kappa B and inhibits HIV-1 production in mature human monocytic cells .,,,
 NF kappa B is a potent mediator of specific gene expression in human monocytes and has been shown to play a role in transcription of the HIV-1 genome in promonocytic leukemias .,,,
 There is little information available on the response of NF kappa B to cytokines in normal human monocytes .,,,
" We have used a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat , which contains a tandem repeat of the NF kappa B binding sequence , as a probe in a gel retardation assay to study this transcription factor .",,,
" Using this assay , we have detected NF kappa B in extracts of nuclei from normal human monocytes .",,,
 Treatment of normal monocytes with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) for 4-24 h caused the complete disappearance of NF kappa B from nuclear extracts of monocytes .,,,
 A similar result was obtained with the mature monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 .,,,
 The constitutive transcription factor SP1 was unaffected by addition of TPA .,unaffected;,7;,Negative_regulation;
 The disappearance of NF kappa B from the nucleus was concentration dependent between 10 and 50 ng/ml of phorbol ester .,,,
" In THP-1 cells , TPA also induced a new , faster-migrating NF kappa B species not induced in monocytes .",,,
" Protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine , but not cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor HA-1004 , also dramatically reduced constitutive levels of nuclear NF kappa B .",,,
" Finally , TPA addition to monocytes infected with HIV-1 inhibited HIV-1 replication , as determined by reverse transcriptase assays , in a concentration-dependent manner .",,,
" These results are in striking contrast to the increase in nuclear NF kappa B and HIV-1 replication induced by phorbol esters in promonocytic leukemia cells U937 and HL-60 , and emphasize the importance of studying cytokine regulation of HIV-1 in normal monocytes .",,,

 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) results from infection with a human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .,,,
" The long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region of HIV proviral DNA contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , and this transcriptional activator appears to regulate HIV activation .",,,
 Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kappa B activation .,,,
" The present study was based on reports that antioxidants which eliminate ROS should block the activation of NF-kappa B and subsequently HIV transcription , and thus antioxidants can be used as therapeutic agents for AIDS .",,,
" Incubation of Jurkat T cells ( 1 x 10(6) cells/ml ) with a natural thiol antioxidant , alpha-lipoic acid , prior to the stimulation of cells was found to inhibit NF-kappa B activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( 25 ng/ml ) or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 50 ng/ml ) .",,,
" The inhibitory action of alpha-lipoic acid was found to be very potent as only 4 mM was needed for a complete inhibition , whereas 20 mM was required for N-acetylcysteine .",,,
 These results indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be effective in AIDS therapeutics .,,,
 Activation of lymphokine genes in T cells : role of cis-acting DNA elements that respond to T cell activation signals .,,,
 Activation of T cells is initiated by the recognition of antigen on antigen presenting cells to exert the effector functions in immune and inflammatory responses .,,,
 Two types of helper T cell ( Th ) clones ( Th1 and Th2 ) are defined on the basis of different patterns of cytokine ( lymphokine ) secretion .,,,
 They determine the outcome of an antigenic response toward humoral or cell-mediated immunity .,,,
" Although lymphokine genes are coordinately regulated upon antigen stimulation , they are regulated by the mechanisms common to all as well as those which are unique to each gene .",,,
" For most lymphokine genes , a combination of phorbol esters ( phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate , PMA ) and calcium ionophores ( A23187 ) is required for their maximal induction .",,,

 GM2 defines a binding site for protein(s) whose binding is inducible by PMA .,,,
" One protein , NF-GM2 is similar to the transcription factor NF-kB .",,,
 GC-box is a binding site for constitutively bound proteins .,,,
 CLEO defines a binding site for protein(s) whose optimum binding is stimulated by PMA and A23187 .,,,

 TAR-independent transactivation by Tat in cells derived from the CNS : a novel mechanism of HIV-1 gene regulation .,,,

" Tat , a potent activator of HIV-1 gene expression , serves to greatly increase the rate of transcription directed by the viral promoter .",,,

 A Tat - responsive element is found upstream within the viral promoter that in glial-derived cell lines allows transactivation in the absence of TAR .,,,
" Deletion mapping and hybrid promoter constructs demonstrate that the newly identified Tat - responsive element corresponds to a sequence within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) previously identified as the HIV-1 enhancer , or NF-kappa B domain .",,,
 DNA band-shift analysis reveals NF-kappa B binding activity in glial cells that differs from that present in T lymphoid cells .,,,

 A novel mitogen-inducible gene product related to p50 / p105 - NF-kappa B participates in transactivation through a kappa B site .,,,

 The cDNA has an open reading frame of 900 amino acids capable of encoding a 97-kDa protein .,,,
 This protein is most similar to the 105-kDa precursor polypeptide of p50 - NF-kappa B .,,,

" For further mapping purposes , a fusion promoter was constructed with the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter containing 60 base pairs of sequence upstream from the cap site of the mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene and various lengths of the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-4 gene .",,,

 Binding of erythroid and non-erythroid nuclear proteins to the silencer of the human epsilon-globin - encoding gene .,,,
 To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the developmental control of hemoglobin-encoding genes we have been studying the expression of these genes in human cells in continuous culture .,,,
" We have previously reported the presence of a transcriptional control element with the properties of a silencer extending from -392 to -177 bp relative to the cap site of the human epsilon-globin - encoding gene [ Cao et al. , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 86 ( 1989 ) 5306-5309 ] .",,,

" Using deletion mutants and cis-cloned synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides in transient expression assays , nucleotide sequences responsible for this effect have now been further delimited to 44 bp located from -294 to -251 bp .",,,
 Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting assays demonstrate that these negative regulatory sequences are recognized differently by proteins present in nuclear extracts obtained from HeLa and K562 cells .,,,

 Human T cell activation through the activation-inducer molecule / CD69 enhances the activity of transcription factor AP-1 .,,,
 The induction of the AP-1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T cell differentiation and activation .,,,
 We have studied the regulation of AP-1 activity in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes stimulated through the activation inducer molecule ( AIM ) / CD69 activation pathway .,,,
 Phorbol esters are required to induce AIM / CD69 cell-surface expression as well as for triggering the proliferation of T cells in conjunction with anti - AIM mAb .,expression;,11;,Localization;
" Mobility shift assays showed that addition of anti - AIM mAb to PMA-treated T lymphocytes markedly enhanced the binding activity of AP-1 to its cognate sequence , the phorbol ester response element .",,,
" In contrast , anti - AIM mAb did not induce any change in the binding activity of NF-kappa B , a transcription factor whose activity is also regulated by protein kinase C .",,,

 Specific NF-kappa B subunits act in concert with Tat to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription .,,,
 NF-kappa B is a protein complex which functions in concert with the tat-I gene product to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) transcription .,,,
" To determine whether specific members of the NF-kappa B family contribute to this effect , we have examined the abilities of different NF-kappa B subunits to act with Tat-I to stimulate transcription of HIV in Jurkat T-leukemia cells .",,,
" We have found that the p49(100) DNA binding subunit , together with p65 , can act in concert with Tat-I to stimulate the expression of HIV - CAT plasmid .",stimulate;expression;,22;24;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Little effect was observed with 50-kDa forms of p105 NF-kappa B or rel , in combination with p65 or full-length c-rel , which do not stimulate the HIV enhancer in these cells .",effect;,2;,Positive_regulation;

 Heterodimerization and transcriptional activation in vitro by NF-kappa B proteins .,,,
" The NF-kappa B family of transcription proteins represents multiple DNA binding , rel related polypeptides that contribute to regulation of genes involved in immune responsiveness and inflammation , as well as activation of the HIV long terminal repeat .",,,
 In this study multiple NF-kappa B related polypeptides ranging from 85 to 45 kDa were examined for their capacity to interact with the PRDII regulatory element of interferon beta and were shown to possess distinct intrinsic DNA binding affinities for this NF-kappa B site and form multiple DNA binding homo- and heterodimer complexes in co-renaturation experiments .,,,
" Furthermore , using DNA templates containing two copies of the PRDII domain linked to the rabbit beta globin gene , the purified polypeptides specifically stimulated NF-kappa B dependent transcription in an in vitro reconstitution assay as heterodimers but not as p50 homodimers .",,,
 These experiments emphasize the role of NF-kappa B dimerization as a distinct level of transcriptional control that may permit functional diversification of a limited number of regulatory proteins .,,,
 Oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a B-cell-restricted activity .,,,
 Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Oct2 could efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif .,expression;,8;,Gene_expression;
" Oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells , however .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 We have tested a variety of Oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a B-cell line .,generated;,9;,Positive_regulation;
 Our analyses show that several Oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to B cells .,,,
 This result indicates the involvement of either a B-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the Oct2 protein in Oct2 - mediated enhancer activation .,,,
 Mutational analyses indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of Oct2 is critical for enhancer activation .,,,
" Moreover , this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein , which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position .",,,
 The glutamine-rich activation domain present in the amino-terminal portion of Oct2 and the POU domain contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position .,,,
 Transcription factor AP-2 activates gene expression of HTLV-I .,,,
 The HTLV-I LTR contains three conserved regulatory elements known as 21 base pair repeats which are required for stimulation of gene expression by the transactivator protein tax .,,,
" Mutagenesis indicates that the 21 bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs , A , B and C , each of which influences the level of tax activation .",activation;,29;,Positive_regulation;
 The A site in the 21 bp repeat has strong homology with previously described binding sites for the transcription factor AP-2 .,,,
 We demonstrated that AP-2 mRNA was present in T-lymphocytes and that cellular factors from both non-transformed and transformed T-lymphocytes specifically bound to the consensus motif for AP-2 in each 21 bp .,,,
" To determine the role of AP-2 in the regulation of the HTLV-I LTR gene expression , we used an AP-2 cDNA in DNA binding and transient expression assays .",,,
" Gel retardation and methylation interference studies revealed that bacterially produced AP-2 bound specifically and with high affinity to all three 21 bp repeats , and that it required the core sequence AGGC for specific binding .",,,
 Binding of AP-2 prevented the subsequent binding of members of the CREB/ATF family to an adjacent regulatory motif in the 21 bp repeat .,,,
 Transfection of an AP-2 expression construct into T-lymphocytes activated gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR .,,,
 At least two 21 bp repeats were required for high levels of AP-2 activation and mutagenesis of the AP-2 consensus binding sequences in the 21 bp repeats eliminate this activation .,,,

 Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while TNF alpha activation was not .,,,
" Furthermore , while PMA activation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor staurosporin , the TNF alpha effect was unchanged .",,,
 TNF alpha did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators .,,,
" Moreover , cAMP activators did not activate NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells .",,,
" Thus , TNF alpha - induced NF-kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein kinase A , or Ca(2+)-regulated kinases .",,,

" We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by clone pAT 133 , which is induced upon transition from a resting state ( G0 ) through the early phase of the cell cycle ( G1 ) .",,,
" The pAT 133 gene is immediately induced , with FOS-like kinetics , in human T cells and in fibroblasts .",,,
 Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three tandem zinc-finger sequences of the type Cys2-Xaa12-His2 .,,,
" This zinc-finger region , which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner , is similar ( greater than 80 % on the amino acid level ) to two previously described transcription factors pAT 225 / EGR1 and pAT 591 / EGR2 .",,,
" Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains , the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct .",,,
 This structural similarity suggests that the pAT 133 gene encodes a transcription factor with a specific biological function .,,,
 Comparing the regulation of these related zinc-finger-encoding genes showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T lymphocytes and of resting fibroblasts .,regulation;,3;,Regulation;
" However , upon transition from a proliferating ( G1 ) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated .",regulated;,24;,Regulation;
" In human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed , whereas mRNA of pAT 225 / EGR1 was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation .",induced;,23;,Positive_regulation;
 In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591 / EGR2 was not expressed in these cells .,expressed;,11;,Transcription;
 This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins .,,,
 Every enhancer works with every promoter for all the combinations tested : could new regulatory pathways evolve by enhancer shuffling ?,,,
" The promoters and enhancers of cell type-specific genes are often conserved in evolution , and hence one might expect that a given enhancer has evolved to work best with its own promoter .",,,
" While this expectation may be realized in some cases , we have not found evidence for it .",,,
 A total of 27 combinations of different promoters and enhancers were tested by transfection into cultured cells .,,,
" We found that the relative efficiency of the enhancers is approximately the same , irrespective of the type of promoter used , i.e. , there was no strong preference for any given enhancer/promoter combination .",,,
" Notably , we do not see particularly strong transcription when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter .",,,
" We propose that a generally permissive enhancer/promoter interaction is of evolutionary benefit for higher eukaryotes : by enhancer shuffling , genes could be easily brought under a new type of inducibility/cell type specificity .",,,
 Towards a molecular understanding of T-cell differentiation .,,,
 Lymphoid differentiation is one of the best studied examples of mammalian development .,,,
 Here Hans Clevers and Michael Owen describe how the cloning of the genes that encode T-cell-specific membrane proteins allows the identification of transcription factors that control the expression of these T-cell genes .,,,
 Such transcription factors play a key role in the development of the mature T-cell phenotype by functioning as ' master regulators of T-cell differentiation ' .,,,
 Transcription factor requirements for U2 snRNA-encoding gene activation in B lymphoid cells .,,,
" Transcription of a human U2 small nuclear RNA(snRNA)-encoding gene in HeLa cells requires a distal enhancer element , which is composed of one octamer motif ( Oct ) and three Sp 1 - binding sites .",,,
" To study the transcription factor requirement in B-cells , different U2 enhancer constructions were transfected into the lymphoid cell line , BJA-B .",,,
 The results showed that the activation of U2 snRNA transcription in B-cells also requires an enhancer comprising both the Oct and at least one Sp 1-binding site .,,,
" Deletion of all the Sp 1 - binding sites from the enhancer reduces transcription by 80-90 % in HeLa , as well as in BJA-B cells , whereas the removal of the octamer-binding site reduces transcription to levels below detection in both cell types .",,,
" Enhancers containing a single Oct have , nevertheless , the capacity to partially activate U2 snRNA transcription in both HeLa cells , in which only OTF-1 is expressed , and in BJA-B cells in which OTF-2 is the predominantly expressed octamer-binding factor .",expressed;expressed;,28;40;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" The most likely interpretation of our results is that both the ubiquitous transcription factor , OTF-1 , and the B-cell-specific transcription factor , OTF-2 , can activate U2 snRNA transcription .",,,
" The results also revealed a similar functional cooperation between the transcription factors which bind to the Oct and the adjacent Sp 1 - binding site in BJA-B cells , as has been observed in HeLa cells , since a template which contains a weak binding site for OTFs expresses wild-type levels of U2 snRNA in both cell types when the weak octamer-binding site is combined with a Sp 1 - binding site .",,,
 Kappa B-specific DNA binding proteins are differentially inhibited by enhancer mutations and biological oxidation .,,,
 Kappa B ( kappa B ) enhancer binding proteins isolated from the nuclei of activated human T cells produce two distinct nucleoprotein complexes when incubated with the kappa B element from the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene .,,,
" These two DNA-protein complexes are composed of at least four host proteins ( p50 , p55 , p75 , p85 ) , each of which shares structural similarity with the v-rel oncogene product .",,,
 Nuclear expression of these proteins is induced with distinctly biphasic kinetics following phorbol ester activation of T cells ( p55 / p75 early and p50 / p85 late ) .,expression;induced;,2;7;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" DNA-protein crosslinking studies have revealed that the more rapidly migrating B2 complex contains both p50 and p55 while the more slowly migrating B1 complex is composed of p50 , p55 , p75 , and p85 .",migrating;migrating;,10;22;,Localization;Localization;
 Site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type IL-2R alpha kappa B enhancer ( GGGGAATCTCCC ) has revealed that the binding of p50 and p55 ( B2 complex ) is particularly sensitive to alteration of the 5' triplet of deoxyguanosine residues .,binding;sensitive;,18;29;,Binding;Regulation;
" In contrast , formation of the B1 complex , reflecting the binding of p75 and p85 , critically depends upon the more 3' sequences of this enhancer element .",binding;depends;,12;19;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
" DNA binding by all four of these Rel-related factors is blocked by selective chemical modification of lysine and arginine residues , suggesting that both of these basic amino acids are required for binding to the kappa B element .",binding;blocked;binding;,2;11;33;,Binding;Negative_regulation;Binding;
" Similarly , covalent modification of free sulfhydryl groups with diamide ( reversible ) or N-ethylmaleimide ( irreversible ) results in a complete loss of DNA binding activity .",loss;,23;,Negative_regulation;

 These findings suggest that reduced cysteine thiols play an important role in the DNA binding activity of this family of Rel-related transcription factors .,,,
 Activity of the kappa B enhancer of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain in somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by the nuclear localization of NF-kappa B .,,,
" The two nuclear proteins NF-kappa B ( consisting of subunits p50 and p65 ) and the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B ( p50 ) by itself , also called KBF1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human T-cell line IARC 301.5 .",expressed;localized;,34;36;,Gene_expression;Localization;
" In order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa B enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301.5 and a murine myeloma .",bind;,13;,Binding;
" Most hybrids express both KBF1 and NF-kappa B in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only KBF1 .",express;expresses;,3;16;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 The kappa B enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear NF-kappa B .,,,
" These findings show that nuclear NF-kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer , while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient .",,,
 We propose that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of NF-kappa B and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes during the immune response .,expression;,23;,Gene_expression;
 Stimulation of interferon beta gene transcription in vitro by purified NF-kappa B and a novel TH protein .,Stimulation;transcription;,1;6;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;

" Also , an induction specific DNA binding protein was purified from HeLa cells that interacted with the (AAGTGA)4 tetrahexamer sequence and the PRDI domain .",,,
 This protein is immunologically distinct from IRF-1 / ISGF2 .,,,
 Uninduced or Sendai virus induced HeLa extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of IFN beta promoter deletions .,,,
" Deletions upstream of the PRDII element increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter .",increased;,7;,Positive_regulation;

 Characterization of an immediate-early gene induced in adherent monocytes that encodes I kappa B-like activity .,,,
 We have cloned a group of cDNAs representing mRNAs that are rapidly induced following adherence of human monocytes .,,,
" One of the induced transcripts ( MAD-3 ) encodes a protein of 317 amino acids with one domain containing five tandem repeats of the cdc10/ankyrin motif , which is 60 % similar ( 46 % identical ) to the ankyrin repeat region of the precursor of NF-kappa B / KBF1 p50 .",induced;,4;,Positive_regulation;
 The C-terminus has a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site .,,,

" The MAD-3 cDNA encodes an I kappa B-like protein that is likely to be involved in regulation of transcriptional responses to NF-kappa B , including adhesion-dependent pathways of monocyte activation .",,,
" Platelet-activating factor induces phospholipid turnover , calcium flux , arachidonic acid liberation , eicosanoid generation , and oncogene expression in a human B cell line .",,,
 Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response .,,,
" Studies of the actions of platelet-activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets .",,,
 In this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet-activating factor on B lymphocytes .,,,
" Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4 , we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M .",,,
" The inactive precursor , lyso-platelet-activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10(-7) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids .",,,
" We also show that platelet-activating factor from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso-platelet-activating factor was again ineffective .",,,
 We further demonstrate the impact of platelet-activating factor binding to B cells by measuring platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production .,,,
" Moreover , platelet-activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun .",inducing;transcription;,8;9;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 Finally we explored the possible role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase A2 .,,,
" In summary , platelet-activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure B cell line .",,,
 Inhibition of protein phosphatases by okadaic acid induces AP1 in human T cells .,,,
" To examine the role of protein phosphatases in T cell activation , Jurkat cells were treated with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A phosphatases , and nuclear extracts were examined for the presence of AP1 as a measure of early T cell activation .",,,
 Okadaic acid was found to be a potent inducer of AP1 .,,,
" In contrast to phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid occurs predominantly by transcriptional activation of the jun and fos family of proto-oncogenes .",,,
" Surprisingly , while the addition of phytohemagglutinin further enhanced the induction of AP1 , the addition of PMA inhibited it .",,,
" Okadaic acid treatment was found to dramatically increase mRNA transcripts of the jun family of proto-oncogenes including c-jun , junD , and junB and to a lesser extent the fos family including c-fos and fra-1 .",increase;,8;,Positive_regulation;
" By comparison , PMA is a very inefficient inducer of the jun gene family in Jurkat cells .",,,
" Similar to its effect on the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid , PMA inhibits the induction of c-jun mRNA by okadaic acid .",induction;inhibits;induction;,7;15;17;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Transfection of c-jun promoter constructs confirmed the marked difference between PMA and okadaic acid in inducing c-jun transcription .,inducing;transcription;,16;18;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 The induction of AP1 by okadaic acid suggests that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A ( PP1 and PP2A ) may be involved in T cell activation as important negative regulators of the transcription factor AP1 .,,,
 Transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus promoter by human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) strains GS and Z-29 in primary human T lymphocytes and identification of transactivating HHV-6(GS) gene fragments .,,,
 Human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) can activate the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter and accelerate cytopathic effects in HIV-infected human T cells .,,,
 This study examines the regions of the HIV promoter required for HHV-6 transactivation in a heterogeneous population of primary human T lymphocytes with or without antigenic stimulation .,,,
" Two different strains of HHV-6 , GS and Z29 , transactivated the HIV promoter .",,,
" The GS strain transactivated the promoter in both stimulated and resting T cells , while the Z29 strain increased HIV promoter activity only in stimulated T cells .",,,
 Three DNA clones containing HHV-6(GS) genomic fragments transactivated the HIV promoter in cotransfected T cells .,,,
" A 21.4-kb DNA clone , pZVB70 , showed the highest transactivating ability , while two other DNA fragments , pZVB10 ( 6.2 kb ) and pZVH14 ( 8.7 kb ) , showed lower activity .",,,
" One of these clones , pZVH14 , activated the HIV promoter construct containing a mutation in the NF kappa B site .",,,
" However , this mutated NF kappa B promoter was not transactivated during HHV-6(GS) infection or after cotransfection with pZVB70 or pZVB10 .",,,
 These data indicate that the NF kappa B sites of the HIV promoter are essential for its transactivation during HHV-6(GS) infection .,,,
" By increasing HIV promoter activity in primary T lymphocytes , HHV-6 may consequently increase HIV replication , leading to an increase in the cytopathic effect on coinfected human T cells .",,,
 Regulation of M-CSF expression by M-CSF : role of protein kinase C and transcription factor NF kappa B .,Regulation;expression;,1;4;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
" Macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) , also referred to as CSF-1 , regulates the survival , growth , differentiation and functional activity of monocytes by binding to a single class of high-affinity cell surface receptors , known to be the product of the c-fms protooncogene .",binding;,26;,Binding;
 The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the monocyte lineage has suggested that M-CSF may act by an autocrine mechanism .,expression;act;,8;20;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

" Although sensitivity to M-CSF can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function , M-CSF responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level .",,,
" To date , little is known about the intracellular pathway of M-CSF signal transduction .",,,
 We have therefore investigated the changes in protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity upon exposure of monocytes to M-CSF .,,,
 We show that M-CSF activates and translocates PKC .,,,
 Inhibition of PKC by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of M-CSF by M-CSF .,abolishes;induction;,9;10;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , activation of PKC was pertussis-toxin-sensitive and was associated with the detection of an NF kappa B protein in nuclear extracts of M-CSF - induced blood monocytes but not in monocytes exposed to medium treatment only .",,,

 HIV1 infection of human monocytes and macrophages promotes induction or translocation of NF-KB-related factors .,,,
" In 1991 , we demonstrated , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that 3 different factors ( termed B1 , B2 and B3 ) with affinity for the KB-enhancer target sequence were specifically detected in nuclear extracts from HIV1-infected monocytes and macrophages .",,,
 The B2 factor was induced in the nuclei of these cells only upon HIV1 infection .,,,
 The B3 factor was only slightly evident in nuclei of uninfected cells but was readily detectable in nuclei of infected monocytes .,,,
 Its expression remained very low in nuclei of HIV1-infected macrophages .,,,
" In this paper , we demonstrate that the B2 factor is expressed in the cytosol of monocytes and macrophages as a DNA-binding protein , indicating that it is not associated with an inhibitor ( IKB ) .",,,
 This factor remained clustered in the cytosol and was translocated to the nuclei only after HIV1 infection .,,,
 The B3 factor is detected in the cytosol only when cells are HIV1-infected .,,,
 The role of HIV1 infection in the expression and the translocation of these factors is discussed .,,,
 Induction of NF-kappa B during monocyte differentiation is associated with activation of HIV-gene expression .,,,
 Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are important targets of HIV infection .,,,
 We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .,,,
" In parallel with such differentiation , HIV transcription , monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct , is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced NF-kappa B expression .",,,
" Also , in a promonocyte cell line chronically infected with HIV , NF-kappa B expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF alpha .",,,
" Thus , stimulation of monocyte cell lines by phorbol esters or TNF alpha induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription .",,,
 Such a process may have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo and may be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections directly or indirectly involving macrophages .,,,

 Transforming growth factor-beta suppresses human B lymphocyte Ig production by inhibiting synthesis and the switch from the membrane form to the secreted form of Ig mRNA .,,,
 Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) inhibits B cell Ig secretion and reduces B cell membrane Ig expression .,,,

 These findings demonstrate that TGF-beta decreases B lymphocyte Ig secretion by inhibiting the synthesis of Ig mRNA and inhibiting the switch from the membrane form to the secreted forms of mu and gamma mRNA .,,,

 Inhibition of HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B activity by cysteine and cysteine derivatives .,,,
 HIV-1 proviral DNA contains two binding sites for the transcription factor NF-kappa B .,,,
" HIV-1-infected individuals have , on average , abnormally high levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels .",,,
 We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B expression .,,,
 The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) raise the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) level and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected Molt-4 and U937 cells .,,,
" However , inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels .",,,
 Cysteine and NAC also inhibit NF-kappa B activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) gene expression under control of NF-kappa B binding sites in uninfected cells .,inhibit;expression;control;,5;23;25;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Regulation;

 The purified NF-GM2 consists of 50 ( p50 ) and 65 kDa ( p65 ) polypeptides and has a binding activity specific for both the GM-CSF and immunoglobulin kappa ( GGAAAGTCCC ) enhancers .,,,

 Synergism between two distinct elements of the HTLV-I enhancer during activation by the trans-activator of HTLV-I .,,,
" We have conducted functional studies of the enhancer elements of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) using the human T-cell lines Jurkat and MOLT 4 , which are negative for HTLV-I , and MT-2 and TL-Mor , which carry the proviral genome of HTLV-I .",,,
 Two distinct elements have been implicated in function of the HTLV-I enhancer .,,,
 One is the 21-base-pair ( bp ) core element that is responsible for trans-activation by the HTLV-I trans-activator p40tax and that has the ability to bind to cyclic-AMP responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) -like factor(s) .,bind;,26;,Binding;
 The other is a region interposed between the 21-bp elements .,,,
" In this study we demonstrate that a subfragment ( C26 ) in the region between the 21-bp elements is involved in trans-activation by p40tax , possibly through binding to an NF-kappa B-like nuclear factor or factors .",,,
 Formation of the protein-DNA complex with the C26 subfragment was positively affected by p40tax .,,,
" The C26 element conferred partial responsiveness to p40tax when linked to one copy of the 21-bp element that , by itself , showed little activation in response to p40tax .",,,
" However , the C26 element alone , even when repeated , could not be activated by p40tax , unlike other NF-kappa B-binding elements .",,,
" In contrast , the C26 element itself was profoundly activated upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate .",,,
" These findings therefore suggest that the HTLV-I enhancer contains multiple functional elements , including binding sites for at least CREB - and NF-kappa B-like factors , which synergistically cooperate in activation of the HTLV-I enhancer in response to p40tax .",,,
 Our results also demonstrate that TPA-dependent activation of the HTLV-I enhancer may be mediated through the C26 element .,,,
 Inhibition of phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation by dexamethasone is associated with down-regulation of c-fos and c-jun ( AP-1 ) .,down-regulation;,12;,Negative_regulation;
 Previous studies have shown that treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and expression of the c-jun and c-fos early response genes .,,,

 Evaluation of the role of ligand and thermal activation of specific DNA binding by in vitro synthesized human glucocorticoid receptor .,,,
" We have used a DNA-binding/immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the capacity of human glucocorticoid receptor ( hGR ) , generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates , to bind DNA .",,,
" In vitro translated hGR was indistinguishable from native hGR , as determined by migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels , sedimentation on sucrose density gradients , and reactivity with antipeptide antibodies generated against hGR .",,,
" In addition , cell-free synthesized hGR was capable of specific binding to glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) -containing DNA fragments .",,,
" Using this assay system , we have evaluated the contributions of ligand binding and heat activation to DNA binding by these glucocorticoid receptors .",,,
 In vitro translated hGR was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid .,,,
 Treatment with dexamethasone or the antiglucocorticoid RU486 had no additional effect on the DNA-binding capacity when receptor preparations were maintained at 0 C ( no activation ) .,,,
" In contrast , addition of either ligand or antagonist in combination with a heat activation step promoted DNA binding by approximately 3-fold over that of heat-activated unliganded receptors .",,,
 Agonist ( dexamethasone ) was slightly more effective in supporting specific DNA binding than antagonist ( RU486 ) .,,,
 DNA binding by in vitro synthesized GR was blocked by the addition of sodium molybdate to the receptor preparations before steroid addition and thermal activation .,,,
 Addition of KCl resulted in less DNA binding either due to blockage of DNA-receptor complex formation or disruption of the complexes .,,,
 The specificity of DNA binding by cell-free synthesized hGR was analyzed further by examining the abilities of various DNAs to compete for binding to a naturally occurring GRE found in the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat .,,,
" Oligonucleotides containing the consensus GRE were the most efficient competitors , and fragments containing regulatory sequences from glucocorticoid-repressible genes were somewhat competitive , whereas single stranded oligonucleotides were unable to compete for mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat DNA binding , except when competitor was present at extremely high concentrations .",,,
" Together these studies indicate that hGR synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates displays many of the same properties , including GRE-specific DNA binding , observed for glucocorticoid receptor present in cytosolic extracts of mammalian cells and tissues .",,,
 Similarities between the effects of dexamethasone and RU486 suggest that the antiglucocorticoid properties of RU486 do not occur at the level of specific DNA binding .,,,
 One base pair change abolishes the T cell-restricted activity of a kB-like proto-enhancer element from the interleukin 2 promoter .,,,
" The inducible , T cell-specific enhancers of murine and human Interleukin 2 ( Il-2 ) genes contain the kB-like sequence GGGATTTCACC as an essential cis-acting enhancer motif .",,,
" When cloned in multiple copies this so-called TCEd ( distal T cell element ) acts as an inducible proto-enhancer element in E14 T lymphoma cells , but not in HeLa cells .",,,
" In extracts of induced , Il-2 secreting El4 cells three individual protein factors bind to TCEd DNA .",secreting;,7;,Localization;
" The binding of the most prominent factor , named TCF-1 ( T cell factor 1 ) , is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of TCEd .",binding;,2;,Binding;
 TCF-1 consists of two polypeptides of about 50 kD and 105 kD ; the former seems to be related to the 50 kD polypeptide of NF-kB .,,,
" Purified NF-kB is also able to bind to the TCEd , but TCF-1 binds stronger than NF-kB to TCEd DNA .",binds;,14;,Binding;
" The conversion of the TCEd to a ' perfect ' NF-kB binding site leads to a tighter binding of NF-kB to TCEd DNA and , as a functional consequence , to the activity of the ' converted ' TCEd motifs in HeLa cells .",,,
" Thus , the substitution of the underlined A residue to a C within the GGGATTTCACC motif abolishes its T cell-restricted activity and leads to its functioning in both El4 cells and HeLa cells .",,,
 These results indicate that lymphocyte-specific factors binding to the TCEd are involved in the control of T cell specific - transcription of the Il-2 gene .,control;transcription;,15;21;,Regulation;Transcription;
 Negative regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in monocytes : role of the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa NF-kappa B dimer .,,,
" Although monocytic cells can provide a reservoir for viral production in vivo , their regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription can be either latent , restricted , or productive .",,,
 These differences in gene expression have not been molecularly defined .,,,
" In THP-1 cells with restricted HIV expression , there is an absence of DNA-protein binding complex formation with the HIV-1 promoter-enhancer associated with markedly less viral RNA production .",,,
 This absence of binding was localized to the NF-kappa B region of the HIV-1 enhancer ; the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa NF-kappa B heterodimer was preferentially lost .,heterodimer;lost;,23;26;,Binding;Negative_regulation;

" Isolation of a candidate repressor/activator , NF-E1 ( YY-1 , delta ) , that binds to the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu E1 site .",binds;,15;,Binding;
 We have determined that the developmental control of immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer ( kappa E3' ) activity is the result of the combined influence of positive- and negative-acting elements .,,,
 We show that a central core in the kappa E3' enhancer is active at the pre-B-cell stage but is repressed by flanking negative-acting elements .,,,
 The negative-acting sequences repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage .,,,
 We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein ( NF-E1 ) that binds to the negative-acting segment of the kappa E3' enhancer .,binds;,17;,Binding;
 This protein also binds to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer mu E1 site .,binds;,4;,Binding;

 The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein contains features characteristic of transcriptional activators as well as transcriptional repressors .,,,
 Cotransfection studies with this cDNA indicate that it can repress basal promoter activity .,,,

 Identification of transcriptional suppressor proteins that bind to the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .,,,
 Two different proteins which independently bound to neighboring sequences within the negative regulatory element ( NRE ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) were detected in the nuclear extract of a virus-infected human T cell line .,,,
 One of the factors bound to a novel dyad symmetrical sequence .,,,
 This sequence is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates and partial homology was found with the promoter region of the human retinoblastoma gene .,,,
 Similar DNA binding activity was detected in a variety of virus-uninfected human T cell lines and HeLa cells by means of a gel mobility shift assay .,,,
 The other factor bound to a putative AP-1 recognition sequence predicted for the HIV-1 NRE .,,,
" However , this factor did not bind to a typical AP-1 site .",,,
" The insertion of multiple copies of the binding site for the former or latter factor into a heterologous promoter reduced the promoter activity to one-tenth or one-third , respectively .",,,
" Thus , each factor may function as a novel negative regulator of transcription .",,,
 Constitutive activation of NF-kB in human thymocytes .,,,
 NF-kB is a eukaryotic transcription regulatory factor .,,,
" In T cells and T cell lines , NF-kB is bound to a cytoplasmic proteic inhibitor , the IkB .",,,
 Treatment of T cells with mitogens ( phorbol esters ) or cytokines ( TNF alpha ) induces NF-kB nuclear translocation and the subsequent expression of NF-kB dependent T cell genes .,,,
 Here we examined the activation of NF-kB in human T cell thymic progenitors .,,,
 We report differences in (Ca2+)i requirement for NF-kB activation in thymocytes as compared to mature T cells .,,,
" Furthermore , our results indicated that thymocytes have a constitutively active form of NF-kB , suggesting that they are activated in vivo .",,,
 Suppression of signals required for activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B in cells constitutively expressing the HTLV-I Tax protein .,expressing;,15;,Gene_expression;

 The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression .,,,
 Stimulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) gene expression by the cytomegalovirus and HIV-2 transactivator gene .,,,
 Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often causes latent infection .,,,
 Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis .,,,
 The transactivator ( IE-2 ) gene of the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro .,,,
 This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4 + lymphocytes .,,,
" While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action , the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components .",,,
" Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation , with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation .",,,
 A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators .,,,
 Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4 + lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element .,,,
 Human immunodeficiency virus type-2 gene expression : two enhancers and their activation by T-cell activators .,,,
" The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) may include a spectrum of retroviruses with varying potential to infect their host , undergo long periods of latent infection , and induce pathology .",,,
" Since expression of the viruses is in large part regulated by the sequence elements in their long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) , this study was directed to an analysis of the regulatory elements in the HIV-2 LTR .",,,
 The HIV-2 LTR was found to contain two enhancers .,,,
" One of these enhancers is , in part , identical to the HIV-1 enhancer .",,,
" This enhancer in HIV-1 is the T-cell activation response element ; in HIV-2 , however , it is the second enhancer that is mainly responsible for activation in response to T-cell activators .",,,
 The second enhancer interacts with two nuclear binding proteins ( 85 kD and 27 kD mobility ) that appear to be required for optimal enhancer function and activation .,,,
 Observations such as these encourage the speculation that there may be subtle differences in the regulation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 expression that may be relevant to the possible longer latency and reduced pathogenicity of HIV-2 .,,,
 Induction of NF-KB during monocyte differentiation by HIV type 1 infection .,,,
" The production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) progeny was followed in the U937 promonocytic cell line after stimulation either with retinoic acid or PMA , and in purified human monocytes and macrophages .",,,
 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blotting experiments were used to detect the binding of cellular transactivation factor NF-KB to the double repeat-KB enhancer sequence located in the long terminal repeat .,,,
" PMA treatment , and not retinoic acid treatment of the U937 cells acts in inducing NF-KB expression in the nuclei .",,,
" In nuclear extracts from monocytes or macrophages , induction of NF-KB occurred only if the cells were previously infected with HIV-1 .",,,
" When U937 cells were infected with HIV-1 , no induction of NF-KB factor was detected , whereas high level of progeny virions was produced , suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication .",,,
" These results indicate that in monocytic cell lineage , HIV-1 could mimic some differentiation/activation stimuli allowing nuclear NF-KB expression .",,,
 Positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression by a novel B-cell-specific enhancer element .,,,
 A new B-cell-specific enhancer element has been identified 3' of E4 and the octamerlike motifs in the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer .,,,
" Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluI fragment , when fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the conalbumin promoter , stimulated transcription in B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells .",,,
" Footprinting analysis revealed that the identical sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG , designated E6 , was protected by nuclear extracts from B cells , T cells , or HeLa cells .",,,
 Gel mobility shift assays using a synthetic E6 motif detected a B-cell-specific complex in addition to a ubiquitous band found also in T cells and HeLa cells .,,,
" In agreement with the results of gel retardation assays , tandem copies of the E6 motif stimulated transcription in ARH77 and Raji cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells .",,,
" Furthermore , a mutant E6 motif lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity .",,,
" In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a B-cell-specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .",,,
" Interestingly , the MnlI-AluI fragment could suppress the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells .",,,
" Moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the MnlI-AluI fragment in HeLa cells but not in B cells .",,,
" Thus , the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both positive and negative factors .",,,
 The NF kappa B independent cis-acting sequences in HIV-1 LTR responsive to T-cell activation .,,,
 The rate of transcription initiation directed by the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 increases in response to mitogenic stimuli of T cells .,,,
 Here we show that the response of the HIV-1 LTR may be governed by two independent sequences located 5' to the site of transcription initiation sequences that bind either NFAT-1 or NF kappa B .,bind;,28;,Binding;
" The rate of LTR-directed gene expression increased in response to treatment with either a phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha if either the NFAT-1 or NF kappa B binding sites were deleted , but failed to respond to these mitogenic stimuli if both sequences were absent .",,,
" The HIV-1 mutant virus containing both NF kappa B and NFAT-1 deletion was able to replicate although at a much decreased growth rate , while the deletion of NFAT-1 alone increased the viral growth rate in Jurkat cells .",,,
 Neither deletion of NF kappa B nor deletion of NFAT-1 decreased activation of viral replication by phorbol ester .,,,
 Comparison of constitutive and inducible transcriptional enhancement mediated by kappa B-related sequences : modulation of activity in B cells by human T-cell leukemia virus type I tax gene .,,,
" The kappa B sequence ( GGGACTTTCC ) binds a factor , NF-kappa B , that is constitutively found in its functional , DNA binding form only in B lymphocytes .",,,
" A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types , where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression .",,,
" For example , kappa B-related sequences have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes , such as the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain gene and the beta-interferon gene .",transcription;,15;,Transcription;
" However , these genes are not constitutively active in B lymphocytes , suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression .",active;,8;,Positive_regulation;
 We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five kappa B-related sequence elements in two different cell types .,,,
 We show that in S194 plasma cells the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of B-cell-derived NF-kappa B for that element .,,,
 This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the interleukin 2 receptor or T-cell receptor genes in S194 cells .,,,
" However , in either EL-4 ( T ) cells or S194 cells , both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I , showing that NF-kappa B activity can be modulated even in a B-cell line that constitutively expresses this factor .",,,
 Isolation of a rel-related human cDNA that potentially encodes the 65-kD subunit of NF-kappa B [ published erratum appears in Science 1991 Oct 4;254(5028):11 ],,,
" A DNA probe that spanned a domain conserved among the proto-oncogene c-rel , the Drosophila morphogen dorsal , and the p50 DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B was generated from Jurkat T cell complementary DNA with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and degenerate oligonucleotides .",,,
 This probe was used to identify a rel-related complementary DNA that hybridized to a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA present in human T and B lymphocytes .,,,
 In vitro transcription and translation of the complementary DNA resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of 65 kilodaltons ( kD ) .,,,
 The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif .,,,
 This protein-DNA complex comigrated with the complex obtained with the purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit and binding was inhibited by I kappa B-alpha and -beta proteins .,,,
" In addition , the 65-kD protein associated with the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B and the kappa B probe to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the NF-kappa B-DNA complex .",associated;,7;,Binding;
 Therefore the rel-related 65-kD protein may represent the p65 subunit of the active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex .,,,
 Murine and human T-lymphocyte GATA-3 factors mediate transcription through a cis-regulatory element within the human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer .,through;,9;,Binding;
 A family of transcriptional activators has recently been identified in chickens ; these transcriptional activators recognize a common consensus motif ( WGATAR ) through a conserved C4 zinc finger DNA-binding domain .,,,
" One of the members of this multigene family , cGATA-3 , is most abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte cell lineage .",expressed;,15;,Gene_expression;
 Analysis of human and murine GATA-3 factors shows a striking degree of amino acid sequence identity and similar patterns of tissue specificity of expression in these three organisms .,expression;,24;,Gene_expression;
 The murine and human factors are abundantly expressed in a variety of human and murine T-cell lines and can activate transcription through a tissue-specific GATA-binding site identified within the human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer .,expressed;,8;,Gene_expression;
 We infer that the murine and human GATA-3 proteins play a central and highly conserved role in vertebrate T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation .,,,
 Processing of the precursor of NF-kappa B by the HIV-1 protease during acute infection .,,,
 Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) genome is regulated in part by cellular factors and is stimulated by activation of latently infected T cells .,,,
 T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor NF-kappa B which binds to two adjacent sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat .,,,
" This factor consists of two DNA-binding subunits of relative molecular mass 50,000 ( 50K ) associated with two 65K subunits .",,,
" It is located in the nucleus in mature B cells , but is present in other cell types as an inactive cytoplasmic complex .",,,
" External stimuli , including those that activate T cells , result in nuclear translocation of active NF-kappa B .",,,
" The cloning of the complementary DNA for the 50K subunit helped to identify an exclusively cytoplasmic 105K precursor ( p105 ) ( V.B. , P.K. and A.I. , manuscript submitted ) .",,,
 The expression of active NF-kappa B might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of p105 .,,,
" Because HIV-1 requires active NF-kappa B for efficient transcription , we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the human 105K precursor .",,,
 We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex .,process;,9;,Positive_regulation;
 HIV enhancer activity perpetuated by NF-kappa B induction on infection of monocytes [ see comments ],,,
 Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) differs in T lymphocytes and macrophages .,,,
" In T cells , HIV transcription is poorly detected in vivo .",,,
" Cloned , normal T lymphocytes show very little , if any , basal activity of the HIV enhancer and low nuclear expression of NF-kappa B , a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV enhancer .",,,
" In contrast , fixed tissue macrophages express detectable HIV proteins , indicating permanent virus transcription .",,,
 One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in macrophages could be sustained nuclear NF-kappa B expression .,,,
" However , the U937 monocytic cell line , which is fully permissive to HIV replication , is known to express only low levels of nuclear NF-kappa B .",,,
 We show here that chronic HIV infection results in both induction of a nuclear factor with antigenic properties indistinguishable from those of NF-kappa B and permanently increased HIV enhancer activity .,,,
" This phenomenon , which is independent of tumour necrosis factor , is associated with HIV replication , and is thus likely to explain at least in part the perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes .",,,
 Tissue-specific expression of the platelet GPIIb gene .,expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 One of the major objectives in the study of thrombogenesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a hematopoietic progenitor is activated and committed to the megakaryocytic lineage .,,,
 Recent development of primary cultures of human megakaryocytes and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis .,,,
" One gene of interest is the glycoprotein IIb ( GPIIb ) gene ; GPIIb , the alpha subunit of the platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa , is produced in megakaryocytes at an early stage of the differentiation , whereas the other subunit of this complex , GPIIIa , is expressed in other cells .",produced;expressed;,26;48;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

" Within this region , we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in DNAse I footprints and gel mobility shift assays .",,,
" One region , centered at -54 , is similar to a nuclear factor E1 - binding site , and a region located at position -233 contains a CCAAT motif .",,,
" Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540 , respectively , bind proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and nonrelated cells as well .",,,
" Finally , two other domains , located at positions -460 and -510 , interact with proteins that are only present in megakaryocytic cells .",,,
" In addition , deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity .",,,
 It is very likely that these domains bind megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins acting as positive transcription factors .,,,
 Cortivazol mediated induction of glucocorticoid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in wild-type and dexamethasone-resistant human leukemic ( CEM ) cells .,induction;,3;,Positive_regulation;
 Cortivazol is a phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid of high potency and unusual structure .,,,
" In both wild-type and highly dexamethasone(dex)-resistant clones of the human leukemic cell line CEM , exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death .",,,

" Positive induction of GR mRNA might be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of normal and dex-resistant CEM cells , or might serve as a marker for the process .",,,

 Human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene regulation in phorbol ester stimulated T and B cell lines .,regulation;,7;,Regulation;
 The minimal region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene promoter necessary for its transcriptional induction by phorbol esters ( PMA ) in human T and B lymphocyte cell lines has been localized between -52 and +89 nucleotides ( nt ) relative to the gene 's transcriptional start site .,necessary;,16;,Positive_regulation;

" Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter ( kappa 1 , kappa 2 , and kappa 3 ) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts , TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines .",bind;induction;,20;33;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
" Moreover , kappa 1-kappa 3 can each be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA .",inducibility;,21;,Positive_regulation;

" Surprisingly , multimers of kappa 1-kappa 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B ( Raji ) , but not a T ( HUT78 ) cell line .",,,

 Reactive oxygen intermediates as apparently widely used messengers in the activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor and HIV-1 .,,,
 Hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals are agents commonly produced during inflammatory processes .,,,
" In this study , we show that micromolar concentrations of H2O2 can induce the expression and replication of HIV-1 in a human T cell line .",,,
 The effect is mediated by the NF-kappa B transcription factor which is potently and rapidly activated by an H2O2 treatment of cells from its inactive cytoplasmic form .,,,
" N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a well characterized antioxidant which counteracts the effects of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) in living cells , prevented the activation of NF-kappa B by H2O2 .",,,
" NAC and other thiol compounds also blocked the activation of NF-kappa B by cycloheximide , double-stranded RNA , calcium ionophore , TNF-alpha , active phorbol ester , interleukin-1 , lipopolysaccharide and lectin .",,,
 This suggests that diverse agents thought to activate NF-kappa B by distinct intracellular pathways might all act through a common mechanism involving the synthesis of ROI .,,,
 ROI appear to serve as messengers mediating directly or indirectly the release of the inhibitory subunit I kappa B from NF-kappa B .,,,
 Contribution of NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding motifs to the replicative capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 : distinct patterns of viral growth are determined by T-cell types .,,,
" Starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , lacking all the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites present in the native long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , proviruses containing reconstructed LTRs with individual or combinations of NF-kappa B and Sp1 elements were generated and evaluated for their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation .",,,
 Virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different human T-cell types depending on which element(s) was present in the LTR .,,,
" For example , in experiments involving proviral clones with LTRs containing one or two NF-kappa B elements ( and no Sp1 binding sites ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( peripheral blood lymphocytes = MT4 greater than H9 greater than CEM greater than Jurkat ) was observed .",,,
 Of note was the associated emergence of second-site LTR revertants which involved an alteration of the TATA box .,,,
 These results suggest that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different T-cell types and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of transcriptional factors present .,,,

" The differentiation of T cells into functionally diverse subpopulations is controlled in part , by transcriptional activation and silencing ; however , little is known in detail about the proteins that influence this developmental process .",,,

" TCF-1 alpha , originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the HIV-1 promoter , was found to bind to the TCR alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T-cell development than the TCR alpha gene ( e.g. , p56lck and CD3 delta ) .",bind;promoters;expressed;,20;28;32;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Sequences related to the TCF-1 alpha binding motif ( 5'-GGCACCCTTTGA-3' ) are also found in the human TCR delta ( and possibly TCR beta ) enhancers .,,,
" Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that TCF-1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57- to 53-kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature T-cell lines ( Jurkat , CCRF-CEM ) and not in mature B cells ( JY , Namalwa ) or nonlymphoid ( HeLa ) cell lines .",derived;,19;,Positive_regulation;
 A small 95-bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the TCF-1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a cAMP-response element ( the CRE or T alpha 1 motif ) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid-specific protein ( TCF-2 alpha ) behaved as a potent T-cell-specific enhancer in vivo .,,,
 Tandem copies of this enhancer functioned synergistically in mature ( Jurkat ) T-cell lines as well as resting and activated immature ( CCRF-CEM ) T-cell lines .,,,
 Mutation of the TCF-1 alpha binding site diminished enhancer activity and disrupted the synergism observed in vivo between tandem enhancer repeats .,,,
" The TCF-1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but not HeLa cells , confirming that TCF-1 alpha is a T-cell-specific transcription factor .",required;,8;,Positive_regulation;
" Curiously , the TCF-1 alpha binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the TCR alpha enhancer and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a heterologous promoter .",,,

 Two distinct transcription factors that bind the immunoglobulin enhancer microE5/kappa 2 motif .,,,
 Activity of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers depends on a complex interplay of ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins .,,,

 A factor known to bind to endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer only in lymphocytes is a ubiquitously active transcription factor .,,,
 The transcriptional enhancer located in the first intron of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region is a major determinant of B-cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .,,,
" Like other enhancers , the Ig heavy chain enhancer contains several short sequence motifs that bind specific transcription factors .",,,
" Each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer , however no single element seems absolutely required for activity .",,,
" For a better understanding of the Ig heavy chain enhancer components , we have cloned and analyzed individual sequence elements .",,,
" We find that the factor that binds to the E3 enhancer motif , CATGTGGC , is a ubiquitous transcription factor .",,,
" It is present in an active form in both B cells and non-B cells , where it can mediate transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo .",,,
" However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , the factor is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated NF-muE3 , was detected in B cells but not in non-B cells .",,,
" From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes : ( a ) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B that are not expressed in most other cell types : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif .",expressed;,39;,Gene_expression;

 Identification of a novel factor that interacts with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter and stimulates transcription in conjunction with the lymphoid cell-specific factor OTF2 .,,,
 The tissue-specific expression of the MOPC 141 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was studied by using in vitro transcription .,,,
" B-cell-specific transcription of this gene was dependent on the octamer element 5'-ATGCAAAG-3' , located in the upstream region of this promoter and in the promoters of all other immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes .",,,
 The interaction of purified octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 ( OTF1 and OTF2 ) with the MOPC 141 promoter was studied by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting .,,,
 Purified OTF1 from HeLa cells and OTF1 and OTF2 from B cells bound to identical sequences within the heavy-chain promoter .,bound;,13;,Binding;
" The OTF interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5'-CTCAGGA-3' , and it seems likely that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter .",binding;involves;,19;24;,Binding;Regulation;
" In addition to these elements , we identified a second regulatory element , the N element with the sequence 5'-GGAACCTCCCCC-3' .",,,
" The N element could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both B-cell and HeLa-cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the octamer element , it can promote high levels of transcription in B-cell extracts .",,,
" The N element bound a transcription factor , NTF , that is ubiquitous in cell-type distribution , and NTF was distinct from any of the previously described proteins that bind to similar sequences .",,,
" Based on these results , we propose that NTF and OTF2 interactions ( both with their cognate DNA elements and possibly at the protein-protein level ) may be critical to B-cell-specific expression and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating gene expression .",,,
 Involvement of a second lymphoid-specific enhancer element in the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene expression .,,,
" To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( OCTA ) -nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor , designated NF-microB , in the murine IgH enhancer .",binding;,40;,Binding;
" We demonstrate that the NF-microB - binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .",,,
 This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .,,,
" Moreover , combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .",,,
" Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .",,,
" Nevertheless , a multimer of the microB motif alone showed no enhancer activity .",,,
 DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microB DNA motif .,,,
 Our results suggest that the microB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity .,,,

 Tandem AP-1-binding sites within the human beta-globin dominant control region function as an inducible enhancer in erythroid cells .,,,

 The formation of this complex also requires both AP-1 sites and correlates with maximal enhancer activity .,,,

 Enhancer activity appears to be mediated by the binding of a complex of proteins from the jun and fos families to tandem AP-1 consensus sequences .,,,

 Two distinct signal transmission pathways in T lymphocytes are inhibited by complexes formed between an immunophilin and either FK506 or rapamycin .,,,
" Proliferation and immunologic function of T lymphocytes are initiated by signals from the antigen receptor that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 but not by its structural analog , rapamycin .",,,
" On the other hand , interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) -induced signals are blocked by rapamycin but not by FK506 .",,,
" Remarkably , these two drugs inhibit each other 's actions , raising the possibility that both act by means of a common immunophilin ( immunosuppressant binding protein ) .",,,
 We find that the dissociation constant of rapamycin to the FK506 binding protein FKBP ( Kd = 0.2 nM ) is close to the dissociation constant of FK506 to FKBP ( Kd = 0.4 nM ) and to their effective biologic inhibitory concentrations .,,,

" FKBP has been shown to catalyze the interconversion of the cis- and trans-rotamers of the peptidyl-prolyl amide bond of peptide substrates ; here we show that rapamycin , like FK506 , is a potent inhibitor of the rotamase activity of FKBP ( Ki = 0.2 nM ) .",,,
 Neither FKBP binding nor inhibition of rotamase activity of FKBP alone is sufficient to explain the biologic actions of these drugs .,,,
" Rather , these findings suggest that immunophilin bound to FK506 interferes with antigen receptor-induced signals , while rapamycin bound to the immunophilin interferes with IL-2 - induced signals .",,,

 Induction of immediate early response genes by macrophage colony-stimulating factor in normal human monocytes .,,,

 We have investigated the induction of these genes by macrophage-CSF ( M-CSF ) in human monocytes that do not proliferate in response to M-CSF but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation .,,,

 Stimulation of a human T-cell clone with anti-CD3 or tumor necrosis factor induces NF-kappa B translocation but not human immunodeficiency virus 1 enhancer-dependent transcription .,,,
 The expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or its enhancer sequence and the translocation of the HIV enhancer-binding protein NF-kappa B were analyzed in two human T-cell clones stimulated through their T-cell receptor complex or by tumor necrosis factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .,,,
 We found a dissociation of NF-kappa B translocation from transactivation of either the HIV LTR or the HIV enhancer .,,,
 Interleukin 2 induced proliferation but not NF-kappa B translocation or LTR transactivation .,,,
" Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced HIV LTR transactivation , whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 did not .",,,
 The two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce NF-kappa B translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester .,,,
 Our finding that induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is not sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation .,,,

 Lymphoid specific gene expression of the adenovirus early region 3 promoter is mediated by NF-kappa B binding motifs .,,,
 A primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is lymphoid cells .,,,
" However , analysis of the viral control elements and the cellular factors that regulate adenoviral gene expression in lymphocytes has not been reported .",,,
" The adenovirus early region 3 ( ES ) gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the class I MHC antigens , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction .",,,
" To determine whether different cellular factors were involved in E3 regulation in lymphocytes as compared with HeLa cells , both DNA binding and transfection analysis with the E3 promoter in both cell types were performed .",,,
 These studies detected two novel domains referred to as L1 and L2 with a variety of lymphoid but not HeLa extracts .,,,
 Each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor NF-kappa B .,,,
" Transfections of E3 constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene revealed that mutagenesis of the distal NF-kappa B motif ( L2 ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in HeLa cells , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by lymphoid cells .",,,
" In contrast , mutagenesis of proximal NF-kappa B motif ( L1 ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both HeLa cells and lymphoid cells but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in lymphoid cells when coupled to the L2 mutation .",,,
 Reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the L1 and L2 domains indicated that the primary sequence of these motifs rather than their position in the E3 promoter was critical for regulating gene expression .,,,
 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),,,
 Characterization of defensin resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the phoP virulence regulon of Salmonella typhimurium .,,,
 The defensin sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phoP / phoQ two-component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins NP-1 and NP-2 .,,,
 Strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair ( phoP [ transcriptional activator ] or phoQ [ membrane sensor kinase ] ) had increased sensitivities to defensin .,,,
 The predicted periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with cationic proteins and that could be responsible for resistance to defensin .,,,
" Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ , we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the absence of PhoP to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product .",expressed;,15;,Gene_expression;
" We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing PhoQ without PhoP were still markedly sensitive to defensins .",expressing;,20;,Gene_expression;
 This implied that a pag ( phoP-activated gene ) product is responsible for defensin resistance .,,,
" We also tested for the ability of defensins NP-1 , NP-5 , and HNP-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have no effect .",,,
" Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP - PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC , as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation ( phenotype PhoPc ) , had no effect on defensin resistance , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages .",,,
 The virulence defect conferred by mutations in the phoP - phoQ two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to cationic proteins and involves the control of other proteins necessary for S. typhimurium survival within macrophages .,,,
 Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway for interleukin-1 .,,,
 Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) -responsive cells blocked IL-1 - induced gene transcription that was driven by the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat .,,,
" This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription , suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types .",,,

 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( HIV-1-LTR ) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but not a T cell line .,,,
 This effect appears to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .,,,
 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from NF-kappa B in U937 and THP-1 cells .,,,
" LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV-1 production from a chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line , U1 , which produces very low levels of HIV-1 at baseline .",,,
 The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) before treatment with LPS .,,,
 This stimulation of HIV-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of HIV-1 RNA and and activation of NF-kappa B .,,,
 LPS is not able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned T cell line .,,,
 The effect of LPS on HIV-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV-1 infection .,,,
 Inducible nuclear factor binding to the kappa B elements of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in T cells can be blocked by cyclosporin A in a signal-dependent manner .,,,
" Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is thought to exert its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the expression of a distinct set of lymphokine genes which are induced upon T-cell activation , among them the gene coding for interleukin-2 .",inhibiting;expression;,14;16;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" In addition , the activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is partially suppressed .",,,
" To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying suppression by CsA , we have investigated the effects of this drug on transcription factors in T cells .",,,
" Here we report that the formation of two distinct mitogen-inducible DNA-binding complexes , the kappa B complex within the HIV enhancer and the NFAT-1 complex within the interleukin-2 enhancer , is inhibited in the presence of CsA .",formation;inhibited;,6;32;,Binding;Negative_regulation;
 The kappa B-binding activity with the HIV enhancer is inhibited only if it is activated via the mitogen phytohemagglutinin whereas phorbol myristate acetate-mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug .,,,
 This suggests a model in which functionally indistinguishable kappa B complexes can be activated via two separate pathways of signal transduction distinguishable by CsA .,,,
 Cell-specific differences in activation of NF-kappa B regulatory elements of human immunodeficiency virus and beta interferon promoters by tumor necrosis factor .,,,
 Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .,,,
 Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937 cell line ( U9-IIIB ) .,production;,9;,Transcription;
" TNF-alpha RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9-IIIB cells .",undetectable;detected;,4;15;,Transcription;Transcription;
" Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of TNF-alpha RNA in U9-IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV-infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF-alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .",induced;increase;produced;,3;8;29;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 The effects of TNF-alpha on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and the beta interferon promoter .,,,
" In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF-alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF-kappa B-containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity .",,,
" Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF-alpha , multimers of the PRDII NF-kappa B-binding domain were inducible by both agents .",stimulated;,10;,Positive_regulation;
" TNF-alpha was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells , but in monocytic cells , TNF-alpha did not induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity .",,,
" This level of NF-kappa B-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since TNF-alpha treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells .",,,
" However , in Jurkat cells , TNF-alpha dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV-1 through the cell population and increased viral RNA synthesis , indicating that in T cells HIV-1 multiplication was stimulated by TNF-alpha treatment .",,,
 Astrocytes and glioblastoma cells express novel octamer-DNA binding proteins distinct from the ubiquitous Oct-1 and B cell type Oct-2 proteins .,,,
" The ' octamer ' sequence , ATGCAAAT or its complement ATTTGCAT , is a key element for the transcriptional regulation of immunoglobulin genes in B-lymphocytes as well as a number of housekeeping genes in all cell types .",,,
" In lymphocytes , the octamer-binding protein Oct-2A and variants thereof are thought to contribute to the B-cell specific gene expression , while the ubiquitous protein Oct-1 seems to control general octamer site-dependent transcription .",,,
" Various other genes , for example interleukin-1 and MHC class II genes , contain an octamer sequence in the promoter and are expressed in cells of both the immune and nervous systems .",,,
 This prompted us to analyze the octamer-binding proteins in the latter cells .,,,
" Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , at least six novel octamer binding proteins were detected in nuclear extracts of cultured mouse astrocytes .",,,
 These proteins are differentially expressed in human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines .,,,
 The nervous system-derived ( N-Oct ) proteins bound to the octamer DNA sequence in a manner which is indistinguishable from the Oct-1 and Oct-2A proteins .,,,
 The relationship of the N-Oct proteins to Oct-1 and Oct-2A was analyzed by proteolytic clipping bandshift assays and by their reactivity towards antisera raised against recombinant Oct-1 and Oct-2A proteins .,,,
" On the basis of these assays , all N-Oct-factors were found to be distinct from the ubiquitous Oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct-2A proteins .",,,
" In melanoma cells that contain the N-Oct-3 factor , a transfected lymphocyte-specific promoter was neither activated nor was it repressed upon contransfection with an Oct-2A expression vector .",,,
 We therefore speculate that N-Oct-3 and other N-Oct factors have a specific role in gene expression in cells of the nervous system .,,,
 Cloning of a mitogen-inducible gene encoding a kappa B DNA-binding protein with homology to the rel oncogene and to cell-cycle motifs .,,,
 We have cloned and characterized a mitogen-inducible gene isolated from human T cells that predicts a protein of 968 amino acids .,,,
 The amino-terminal domain has regions homologous to the oncogene rel and to the developmentally important gene dorsal of Drosophila .,,,
" The carboxy-terminal domain contains repeat structures found in a variety of proteins that are involved in cell-cycle control of yeast and in tissue differentiation in Drosophila and Ceanorhabditis elegans , as well as in the putative human oncogene bcl-3 and in the ankyrin protein .",,,
" A truncated form of the product of this gene translated in vitro is a DNA-binding protein which interacts specifically with the kappa B binding site found in many inducible genes , including the enhancer in human immunodeficiency virus .",,,
 This gene is yet another in a growing list of important regulatory molecules whose expression is transcriptionally induced upon cellular activation .,,,
 Regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides .,,,
 Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation .,,,
" The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods , each with specific limitations .",,,
 Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded ( ds ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences .,,,
 The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B .,,,
 The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner .,,,
 Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line .,,,
 Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer .,inhibited;secretion;,15;20;,Negative_regulation;Localization;
" The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral , immunosuppressive , or other therapeutic effects .",,,
 Differences in transcriptional enhancers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 .,,,
 Response to T cell activation signals .,,,
 T cell activation results in high levels of HIV replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection .,,,
" In HIV-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer , which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) .",,,
" The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus , HIV-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent NF kappa B binding site .",,,
 We demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR responds better than the HIV-2 LTR to T cell activation signals .,,,
 These qualitative differences in the response to T cell activation are reproduced not only when HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective LTR .,,,
" In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , NF kappa B binds to both conserved sites in the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer .",,,
" Instead of NF kappa B , the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in HIV-2 .",binds;,11;,Binding;
" In conclusion , HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals , and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection .",,,
 An in vitro globin gene switching model based on differentiated embryonic stem cells .,,,
 We used mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to study globin gene expression and switching in vitro .,,,
" We show that ES-derived embryoid bodies express the full complement of mouse embryonic globin genes in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation , a switch occurs to the fetal/adult genes .",,,
" In addition , the erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E1 was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of globin in embryoid bodies .",expressed;,13;,Gene_expression;
 We conclude from these experiments that the ES cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development .,,,
" When the human epsilon- or beta-globin genes driven by the dominant control region ( DCR ) are introduced into this system , the human epsilon-globin gene , in contrast to the beta-globin gene , is not deregulated by the presence of the DCR and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene .",deregulated;expressed;,37;46;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 We conclude from this that the epsilon-globin gene is not regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus .,regulated;,11;,Regulation;
 Functional analysis of cis-linked regulatory sequences in the HLA DRA promoter by transcription in vitro .,,,
" Two consensus sequences , called X and Y boxes , capable of binding nuclear proteins and regulating expression in B cells have been defined within the immediate upstream region of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II promoters .",,,
" Unlike other class II promoters , the HLA-DR alpha ( DRA ) promoter also contains one element identical to the "" octamer "" motif of immunoglobulin variable region promoters that is responsible for B cell-specific transcription .",,,
" This "" octamer "" in the context of DRA appears capable of binding both the ubiquitous ( OTF-1 ) and lymphoid-specific ( OTF-2 ) "" octamer "" binding proteins , but at least one other distinct "" octamer "" complex was found .",binding;binding;,13;28;,Binding;Binding;
" In order to characterize the function of cis-acting elements , we have developed an in vitro system in which a DRA promoter construct is transcribed more efficiently in extracts from B cells than in extracts from class II-negative HeLa cells .",,,
" 5' deletion constructs which lacked the Y box , but retained the "" octamer "" motif and TATA box were completely inactive , and internal deletion of the Y box reduced transcription by 95 % .",,,
" Using supercoiled , but not linear templates , we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates lacking or disrupting the X consensus element that reflect effects of random replacement of X box sequences in transient expression assays .",,,
" Demonstration of the complete dependence on the Y box in this system suggests that , despite its demonstrated importance in the DRA promoter , the DRA "" octamer "" does not utilize OTF-2 in a manner analogous to immunoglobulin promoters in B cells .",utilize;,32;,Regulation;
 Characterization of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding proteins from the human T-cell line Jurkat .,,,
 The transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is under the control of cellular proteins that bind to the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .,,,
 Among the protein-binding regions of the HIV-1 LTR is the transcription-enhancer region .,,,
" We show that at least one inducible , C1 , and one constitutive , C2 , protein can bind to the HIV enhancer in Jurkat cells .",bind;,19;,Binding;
" The two proteins differ in their surface charge , since they are separable by anion-exchange chromatography .",,,
 Bivalent cations such as Mg2+ and Zn2+ differentially affect their binding to oligonucleotides which contain the HIV-enhancer domain .,affect;binding;,9;11;,Regulation;Binding;
 Both C1 and C2 proteins also bind to a similar sequence found in the interleukin-2-receptor alpha-subunit enhancer .,bind;,7;,Binding;
 The inducible C1 protein was partially purified by three chromatographic steps and characterized by u.v. cross-linking as a 47 kDa protein .,,,
 The ubiquitous octamer-binding protein(s) is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes .,,,
" All immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved octanucleotide promoter element , ATGCAAAT , which has been shown to be required for their normal B-cell-specific transcription .",,,
" Proteins that bind this octamer have been purified , and cDNAs encoding octamer-binding proteins have been cloned .",,,
" Some of these proteins ( referred to as OTF-2 ) are lymphoid specific , whereas at least one other , and possibly more ( referred to as OTF-1 ) , is found ubiquitously in all cell types .",,,
 The exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes is unclear .,,,
 We have identified two human pre-B-cell lines that contain extremely low levels of OTF-2 yet still express high levels of steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mRNA in vivo and efficiently transcribe an immunoglobulin gene in vitro .,,,
 Addition of a highly enriched preparation of OTF-1 made from one of these pre-B cells or from HeLa cells specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an immunoglobulin gene .,made;,9;,Gene_expression;
" Furthermore , OFT-1 appeared to have approximately the same transactivation ability as OTF-2 when normalized for binding activity .",transactivation;,10;,Positive_regulation;
" These results suggest that OTF-1 , without OTF-2 , is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that OTF-2 alone is not responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression .",,,
 Tax - independent binding of multiple cellular factors to Tax - response element DNA of HTLV-I .,,,
 The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) promoter contains three copies of imperfect repeats of a 21-base pair sequence designated here as TRE ( Tax-response element ) that is responsive to the virally encoded transactivator protein Tax .,,,
" We have identified and separated four nuclear proteins from C81-66-45 cells , an HTLV-I immortalized Tax - expressing human T-lymphocyte line ( Salahuddin et al. , 1983 ) , that interact with the TRE-DNA , none of which are identical with the Tax - protein .",expressing;,18;,Gene_expression;
" The proteins identified have molecular weights of about 32 , 36 to 42 , 50 and 110 kD .",,,
 Four different methods were used to identify the proteins .,,,
" First , from different cell lines three or all four of the nuclear proteins were specifically cross-linked by UV irradiation to the radioactively labeled TRE-DNA fragment .",,,
" Second , TRE-DNA binding proteins sedimented through a glycerol density gradient at rates corresponding to proteins of native molecular weights of 35 to 50 kD and 110 kD .",,,
" Third , only the 50 kD protein was retained on a biotinylated DNA-streptavidin matrix when the DNA fragment contained the TRE-DNA .",,,
" Fourth , extensive purification by several cycles of TRE-DNA affinity chromatography resulted in the 32 , 36 to 42 and 110 kD proteins and to less extent the 50 kD factor .",,,
 Two abundant proteins of 75 and 80 kD were competed out by poly[d(I-C)] in all reactions .,,,
" The cAMP-response element CRE , TGACGTCA , present in the 21 base-pair sequence , appears to be essential for specific protein-TRE-DNA interactions because mutation of the two G 's destroys this complex .",,,
" This result suggests that the cAMP response element binding protein , CREB , is involved in the protein-TRE-DNA complex and in mediating the Tax response .",response;involved;mediating;response;,7;15;22;25;,Regulation;Regulation;Regulation;Regulation;
 Cell type specificity and activation requirements for NFAT-1 ( nuclear factor of activated T-cells ) transcriptional activity determined by a new method using transgenic mice to assay transcriptional activity of an individual nuclear factor .,,,
 Nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NFAT-1 ) is a transcription factor which is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation .,,,
 We have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of NFAT-1 at the single cell level in whole animals .,,,
 The system is based on the use of an oligomerized NFAT-1 binding motif that directs transcription of SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice .,,,
 This report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice .,,,
 NFAT-1 activity had previously been thought to be confined to activated T-lymphocytes upon release of intracellular calcium .,,,
 By targeting NFAT-1 - dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of NFAT-1 activity .,,,
 Besides in T-lymphocytes NFAT-1 activity could also be induced in T-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and purified B-lymphocytes and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C .,induced;requires;,9;18;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 A difference in the time course of appearance of NFAT-1 activity between T-lymphocytes and non-T-lymphocytes was revealed .,appearance;,8;,Positive_regulation;
 Constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions .,,,
" Interestingly , the tissue pattern of expression of the NFAT-1 activity resembles the expression pattern described for HIV-LTR/tat transgenic mice ( Vogel , J. , Hinrichs , S. H. , Reynolds , R. K. , Luciw , P. A. , and Jay , G. ( 1988 ) Nature 335 , 606-611 ) .",expression;expression;,7;14;,Localization;Localization;
 This similarity in expression and the fact that NFAT-1 has been shown to bind functional sequences in HIV-LTR suggest a role for NFAT-1 in dermal activation of the HIV-LTR .,bind;,14;,Binding;
 Octamer transcription factors and the cell type-specificity of immunoglobulin gene expression .,,,
 Antibodies are produced exclusively in B lymphocytes .,,,
" The expression of the antibody-encoding genes , the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes , is also restricted to B cells .",,,
" The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is present in the promoter and the enhancer of Ig genes , and plays an important role in its tissue-specific expression .",,,
" This sequence motif is a binding site for nuclear proteins , the so-called octamer transcription factors ( Oct or OTF factors ) .",,,
" The Oct-1 protein is present in all cell types analyzed so far , whereas Oct-2A and Oct-2B are found mainly in B lymphocytes .",present;found;,5;19;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 All three proteins show the same sequence specificity and binding affinity .,,,
" It appears that the B cell-specific expression of Ig genes is mediated at least in part by cell type-specific Oct factors , and that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between Oct-1 and Oct-2 factors .",,,
" Recently , a number of other octamer factor variants were identified .",,,
 Many of these may be created by alternative splicing of a primary transcript of one Oct factor gene and may serve a specific function in the fine tuning of gene expression .,,,
 Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide induce early events of T cell activation and synergize with TCR cross-linking for CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production .,synergize;expression;production;,15;21;25;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i .,,,
 Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate - thrombin failed to increase [Ca2+]i .,,,
" Furthermore , hirudin and anti - thrombin III inhibited the thrombin - induced [Ca2+]i rise in Jurkat T cells .",,,
" A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [Ca2+]i mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca2+ release exclusively from internal stores .",,,
" Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa .",,,
 There was a good correlation between thrombin - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and Ca2+ mobilization .,,,
 Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane .,,,
" As a likely consequence of these events , thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF-kB .",,,
" Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin , whereas others such as THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL2 , a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation .",,,

 Tolerance to lipopolysaccharide involves mobilization of nuclear factor kappa B with predominance of p50 homodimers .,mobilization;,5;,Localization;
 Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to rapid and transient expression of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) .,,,
" When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS ( 1 microgram/ml ) , expression of the TNF gene is minimal , i.e. the cells are tolerant .",,,
" In nuclear run-on analysis , such tolerant cells show only a low degree of transcription , indicating that tolerance operates at or upstream of the transcription level .",,,
" The CD14 LPS receptor is , however , up-regulated ( not down-regulated ) in tolerant cells , and LPS can , in fact , still lead to activation of tolerant cells as evidenced by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .",,,
" Resolution of the NF-kappa B complex in gel shift analysis shows that the binding protein , mobilized in naive Mono Mac 6 cells , consists mainly of p50 - p65 heterodimers , while in tolerant cells , the p50 homodimer is predominant .",mobilized;,17;,Localization;
" This increase in p50 homodimers coincides with an increase in p105 mRNA , suggestive of a transcriptional up-regulation of p50 .",increase;increase;,2;9;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Reporter gene analysis reveals that the NF-kappa B complex mobilized in tolerant cells is functionally inactive in that NF-kappa B-dependent luciferase constructs containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat or the TNF 5'-region show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation .,,,
" Similar to Mono Mac 6 cells , primary blood monocytes , when precultured with a low dose of LPS , also become tolerant and produce little TNF after LPS stimulation .",,,
" The tolerant blood monocytes also up-regulate CD14 , and they mobilize NF-kappa B with a predominance of p50 homodimers .",up-regulate;,6;,Positive_regulation;

 Alpha-tocopherol inhibits agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion to cultured human endothelial cells .,,,
" Antioxidants have been proposed to be anti-atherosclerotic agents ; however , the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects are poorly understood .",,,
" We have examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol ( alpha-tcp ) on one cellular event in atherosclerotic plaque development , monocyte adhesion to stimulated endothelial cells ( ECs ) .",,,
" Human umbilical vein ECs were pretreated with alpha-tcp before stimulation with known agonists of monocyte adhesion : IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) , LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) , thrombin ( 30 U/ml ) , or PMA ( 10 nM ) .",,,
" Agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion , but not basal adhesion , was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by alpha-tcp .",,,
 The IC50 of alpha-tcp on an IL-1-induced response was 45 microM .,,,

 Our results point to a novel alternative mechanism of action of alpha-tcp .,,,
 Upregulation of bcl-2 by the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 : a B-cell-specific response that is delayed relative to NF-kappa B activation and to induction of cell surface markers .,Upregulation;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" An ability of the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 to enhance the survival of infected B cells through upregulation of the bcl-2 oncogene was first suggested by experiments involving gene transfection and the selection of stable LMP1 + clones ( S.Henderson , M.

 CD14 - mediated translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B induced by lipopolysaccharide does not require tyrosine kinase activity .,,,

 Nuclear translocation of cytosolic NF-kappa B is correlated with a number of LPS-inducible responses .,,,
 We sought to determine if this pathway were present in CHO / CD14 cells and to elucidate the relationship of NF-kappa B activation to the CD14 receptor system .,,,
 LPS-stimulated translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO / CD14 cells resembled the same response in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 .,,,
" Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids , which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines , had no effect on translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO / CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , demonstrating that NF-kappa B translocation is an early event .",,,
" Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264.7 cells , LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated CHO / CD14 cells .",,,
" Furthermore , the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO / CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in RAW 264.7 cells .",,,
 These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for CD14 - mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS .,,,

 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),,,
 Inducible binding to the c-fos serum response element during T cell activation is regulated by a phosphotyrosine-containing protein .,,,

 Fos expression may be a pivotal event in converting ligand-receptor interactions at the membrane into functional modulation of cell phenotype .,expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 The serum response element ( SRE ) in the c-fos regulatory region participates in induction of transcription by various growth factors and by phorbol esters and subsequent squelching of transcription .,,,
" We show that an inducible protein complex ( Band A ) binds to SRE DNA within 10 min after mitogenic stimulation of human PBL-T , and becomes nondetectable by 60 min .",,,
 Band A contains the serum response factor plus additional factor(s) .,,,
 A protein that is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in resting PBL-T suppresses binding of a component of Band A to the SRE motif .,,,
" Upon stimulation of the cells , this protein no longer prevents binding of DNA by Band A , and suppression of binding is restored within 30 min .",,,
 The phosphorylated tyrosine residue itself is important for the protein-protein interaction .,,,

 Separation of oxidant-initiated and redox-regulated steps in the NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway .,,,
" Studies presented here show that overall NF-kappa B signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) individually initiate signaling .",,,
 These initial pathways culminate in a common pathway through which all of the stimulating agents ultimately signal NF-kappa B activation .,,,
" We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF-kappa B activation in only one of two human T-cell lines ( Wurzburg but not Jurkat ) , whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines .",,,
 We propose the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway .,,,
 We include a redox-regulatory mechanism(s) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do n't activate NF-kappa B ) ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF-kappa B activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines .,,,
" Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-kappa B , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF-kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event(s) within the common step of the NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway .",,,

 Accompanying the rapid turnover of the I kappa B alpha protein is simultaneous translocation of NF-kappa B-related transcription factors to nuclei of adhered monocytes .,,,
 The demonstration that NF-kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha / MAD-3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady-state I kappa B alpha / MAD-3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF-kappa B-dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha / MAD-3 gene .,regulate;transcription;increase;,7;15;24;,Regulation;Transcription;Positive_regulation;

 Regulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and E-selectin expression in endothelial cells by cyclosporin A and the T-cell transcription factor NFAT .,Regulation;expression;,1;8;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) was originally described as a T-cell-specific transcription factor athat supported the activation of cytokine gene expression and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .,,,
" As we observed that activated endothelial cells also expressed NFAT , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in endothelial cells .",,,
" Significantly , CsA completely suppressed the induction of NFAT in endothelial cells and inhibited the activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene regulatory elements that use NFAT by 60 % .",,,

" Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis , which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site without a TATA box .",,,
 Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site ( -7 to +13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element ( GIRE ) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site .,,,

 Immunosuppression by glucocorticoids : inhibition of NF-kappa B activity through induction of I kappa B synthesis [ see comments ],,,
 Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .,,,
" They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear .",,,
 Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in mice and cultured cells .,,,
" This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .",,,
" Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids .",,,
 IFN-gamma priming of monocytes enhances LPS-induced TNF production by augmenting both transcription and MRNA stability .,,,
" The induction of cytokine expression in monocytes/macrophages by bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a critical , highly regulated host defence response .",,,
" The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , referred to as priming , is well established .",,,
" However , the mechanism(s) by which priming occurs is poorly defined .",,,
" Using tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes .",,,
 Priming by IFN-gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation .,,,
 IFN-gamma pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response .,,,
" Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF , but not M-CSF .",,,
 Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS .,,,
 The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in nuclear factor-kappa B activity in these cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a consensus NF-kappa B oligonucleotide .,,,
 An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells ( T1/2 increased 6-8-fold ) .,,,
" Consistent with the increased mRNA stability , the duration of mRNA accumulation was longer following LPS stimulation in primed monocytes , in addition to being of greater magnitude .",,,
" Finally , primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89 .",,,

" Moreover , in human T helper ( Th ) clones functionally characterized as being of the type 0 , type 1 and type 2 ( 28 % , < 1 % und 93 % CD30+ , respectively ) , the extent of CD30 - mediated NF-kappa B activation correlated with the proportion of CD30 + cells .",,,

 Vitamin E therapy of acute CCl4-induced hepatic injury in mice is associated with inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B binding .,,,
" Oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , may represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies .",,,
" Oxidative stress enhances nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activity , and NF-kappa B activity has been shown to enhance the expression of cytotoxic cytokines .",,,
 Acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 in mice .,,,
 This injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water-soluble emulsion of alpha-tocopherol .,,,
 Alpha-tocopherol treatment of the mice given the CCl4 also reduced the NF-kappa B binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice .,,,

 The peri-kappa B site mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells .,,,
" Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa .",,,
 HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .,,,
" Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 .",,,
" Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine-rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .",,,
" We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri-kappa B .",,,

" While a nuclear factor(s) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site , electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells , thus supporting the transfection data .",,,
" Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .",,,

 Interleukin 4 activates a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein which interacts with an interferon-gamma activation site-like sequence upstream of the I epsilon exon in a human B cell line .,,,

 A major transcription initiation site was located in three human tissues approximately 560 bp upstream from the translation initiation codon and 380 bp upstream from any previously identified transcription initiation site .,,,
 The thromboxane receptor gene has neither a TATA nor a CAAT consensus site .,,,
 Promoter function of the 5' flanking region of the thromboxane receptor gene was evaluated by transfection of thromboxane receptor gene promoter / chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) chimera plasmids into platelet-like K562 cells .,,,

 Infection and replication of Tat - human immunodeficiency viruses : genetic analyses of LTR and tat mutations in primary and long-term human lymphoid cells .,,,
 Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .,,,
 Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells .,,,

 It is possible that Tat is also needed for other functions during HIV replication .,,,
" To test these hypotheses , we studied several tat mutants , including two stop codon mutants and one deletion mutant using replication-competent HIV-1 constructs carrying wild-type or mutant LTRs with modifications in the NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites .",,,
" In this study , we show that Tat - HIV-1 with wild-type LTRs can replicate in HeLa cells , and the virus produced from HeLa cells can infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages .",,,
 It was found that the propagation of the Tat mutants containing wild-type LTRs was less efficient than that of the LTR-modified Tat mutants .,,,
 Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs .,,,
" However , this efficient propagation of the LTR-modified tat mutants was restricted to some lymphoid cell lines that have been transformed with other viruses .",,,
" Thus , despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block , Tat is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full-length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles .",,,
 Direct sequencing of the viral genomes and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild-type reversion even after prolonged infection with the Tat - virus .,,,
 The implications for in vivo HIV-1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative Tat function are discussed .,,,

 Cytokine modulation of HIV expression .,,,
" Cytokines , the peptide hormones which control the homeostasis of the immune system and also play a fundamental role in inflammatory and immune mediated reactions , have been involved at multiple levels in the pathogenesis of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .",,,
 Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) has been shown to induce production of several cytokines both in vitro and in vivo .,,,
" Conversely , several cytokines modulate the levels of HIV expression in infected cells of both T lymphocytic and mononuclear phagocytic lineage .",,,
" Activated mononuclear cells , particularly B cells which are in a state of chronic activation in HIV infected individuals , release HIV-inductive cytokines and thus play a potentially important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection .",,,
 Inhibition of HIV-1 latency reactivation by dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and an analog of DHEA .,,,
 The initial infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in most individuals usually results in the establishment of a latent or chronic infection before eventual progression toward acquired immunodeficiency syndrome .,,,
 HIV-1 can also establish a latent or persistent infection in some T cell lines that show minimal constitutive virus expression .,,,
" However , activation of the T cell lines leading to enhanced HIV-1 replication can be induced by antigens , mitogens , and cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF-alpha ] , interleukin 1 , and interleukin-2 ) .",,,
" Various gene products from other viruses ( HTLV-1 , HSV , EBV , CMV , HBV , and HHV-6 ) can also enhance HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -driven reporter gene activity .",,,
" On the basis of these observations , it has been proposed that reactivation of latent HIV-1 harbored in chronically infected T lymphocytes , monocytes , or macrophages plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS .",,,
" So far , there are no drugs or therapy available that can provide protection against HIV-1 latency reactivation .",,,
" ACH-2 , derived from a human T cell line ( CEM ) , is chronically infected with HIV-1 , with low levels of constitutive virus expression .",,,
" ACH-2 can be converted to productive infection by stimulation of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , mitogen or cytokines ( TNF-alpha ) , or infection with HSV .",,,
 Therefore the ACH-2 cell line is a good candidate for studying the effects of drugs on HIV-1 activation .,,,
" Previously , we have reported that DHEA and synthetic analogs of DHEA can be modest inhibitors of HIV-1 IIIB replication in phytohemagglutinin - stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures .",,,

 Nitric oxide-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras .,,,
" The protooncogene p21ras , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events .",,,

 In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible .,,,
 Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange .,,,
 The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange .,,,
" Furthermore , we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as NF-kappa B activation , and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell .",activate;,25;,Positive_regulation;

" These functions of PAF appeared to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors , as two PAF receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659,989 , blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity induced by PAF .",mediated;blocked;up-regulation;,8;27;30;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 IL-1 receptor and TCR signals synergize to activate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription .,,,
 Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) - and TCR-initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes .,,,
 In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL-1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF-kappa B .,,,
" The synergistic antigen receptor initiated signals are mediated through protein kinase C because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , but not with calcium ionophores ; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant .",,,
 Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF-kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL-1 rather than by antigen receptor signals .,,,
 Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF-kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) -NF-kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation .,,,
 The IL-1-induced NF-kappa B DNA nuclear localization is transient and can be prolonged either by an antigen receptor-initiated signal or by inhibiting protein synthesis .,,,
 These results suggest that IL-1 induces both NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for terminating NF-kappa B-DNA interaction in the nucleus .,,,
" Antigen receptor signals prolong NF-kappa B-DNA interaction , probably by functionally antagonizing the IL-1-induced synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for the transient NF-kappa B-DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance IL-1-induced NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcription .",,,

 These binding activities are expressed only in activated T cells .,expressed;,5;,Positive_regulation;
 The expression of AP-1 depended on calcium mobilization and PKC activation .,,,
" These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD .",,,
 The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA-binding activity by several transcription factors .,,,
" However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation .",,,
 Interleukin ( IL ) -10 inhibits nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) activation in human monocytes .,,,
 IL-10 and IL-4 suppress cytokine synthesis by different mechanisms .,,,

" Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , we now show that , in monocytes stimulated with LPS or TNF alpha , IL-10 inhibits nuclear stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , a transcription factor involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes .",,,
" Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , GR , CREB , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10 .",affected;,22;,Regulation;
 This selective inhibition by IL-10 of NF kappa B activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with IL-10 's cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness .,,,
" Furthermore , compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit NF kappa B activation block cytokine gene transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes .",,,
" Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of NF kappa B activation may be an important mechanism for IL-10 suppression of cytokine gene transcription in human monocytes .",,,
" IL-4 , another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF kappa B activation .",,,
" Further examination reveals that , unlike IL-10 , IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription .",,,
 These data indicate that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms .,,,

 It was identified as NF-E1 ( YY1 ) .,,,

 Coupling of a signal response domain in I kappa B alpha to multiple pathways for NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth .,,,
 The nuclear activity of NF-kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha .,,,
" This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF-kappa B-inducing agents , including T-cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .",phosphorylated;degraded;,6;8;,Phosphorylation;Protein_catabolism;
" To explore these I kappa B alpha - dependent mechanisms for NF-kappa B induction , we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes .",,,
" Specifically , removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm .",,,
" However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax - expressing cells .",prevented;induced;phosphorylation;,6;8;9;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;
" Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax - induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction , including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors .",,,

 Distinct roles of the molecular chaperone hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function via the basic helix-loop-helix and PAS domains .,,,
 The intracellular dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin and functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor .,,,
 It contains a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) motif contiguous with a Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS ) homology region .,,,
" In extracts from nonstimulated cells the receptor is recovered in an inducible cytoplasmic form associated with the 90-kDa heat shock protein ( hsp90 ) , a molecular chaperone .",,,
 We have reconstituted ligand-dependent activation of the receptor to a DNA-binding form by using the dioxin receptor and its bHLH-PAS partner factor Arnt expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate .,,,
 Deletion of the PAS domain of the receptor resulted in constitutive dimerization with Arnt .,,,
" In contrast , this receptor mutant showed low levels of xenobiotic response element-binding activity , indicating that the PAS domain may be important for DNA-binding affinity and/or specificity of the receptor .",,,
 It was not possible to reconstitute dioxin receptor function with proteins expressed in wheat germ lysate .,,,
" In line with these observations , reticulocyte lysate but not wheat germ lysate promoted the association of de novo synthesized dioxin receptor with hsp90 .",,,
" At least two distinct domains of the receptor mediated interaction with hsp90 : the ligand-binding domain located within the PAS region and , surprisingly , the bHLH domain .",,,
" Whereas ligand-binding activity correlated with association with hsp90 , bHLH-hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA-binding activity but not for dimerization of the receptor .",,,
" Several distinct roles for hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function are therefore likely : correct folding of the ligand-binding domain , interference with Arnt heterodimerization , and folding of a DNA-binding conformation of the bHLH domain .",,,
" Thus , the dioxin receptor system provides a complex and interesting model of the regulation of transcription factors by hsp90 .",,,

 Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene .,,,
 The promoter region between -173 and -60 contained the strongest activating elements .,,,
 The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter .,,,
 We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1 / CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA / PHA .,,,

 Biphasic control of nuclear factor-kappa B activation by the T cell receptor complex : role of tumor necrosis factor alpha .,,,
 The regulation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activation by the T cell receptor ( TcR ) /CD3 complex in primary human T cells has been studied at various times after activation .,,,

 Association of alterations in NF-kappa B moieties with HIV type 1 proviral latency in certain monocytic cells .,,,
 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is controlled by a complex array of virally encoded and cellular proteins .,,,

 Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV-1 replication may differ between certain cell types .,,,
" It is now demonstrated that HIV-1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV-1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross-linking studies .",,,
" A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , rather than the p50 - p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .",homodimers;heterodimer;,11;23;,Binding;Binding;

 The mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in human monocytes/macrophages are partially understood .,,,
 Persistent HIV infection of U937 monocytic cells results in NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 Whether virus-induced NF-kappa B activation is a mechanism that favors continuous viral replication in macrophages remains unknown .,,,
" To further delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of NF-kappa B in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages , we have focused on the regulation of the I kappa B molecules .",,,

 Effects of glucocorticoids on transcription factor activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .,,,
" Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this may be through the modulation of transcription factor binding to DNA .",,,
" The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .",interaction;,2;,Binding;
" TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased AP-1 and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased CREB binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course .",,,
" Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .",,,

 Isolation of cDNA clones for 42 different Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins expressed in the human monoblast cell line U-937 .,,,
" To study the complexity and structural characteristics of zinc finger proteins expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a consensus zinc finger peptide domain was used to isolate 63 cDNA clones for Kruppel-related zinc finger genes from the human monoblast cell line U-937 .",,,
" By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these cDNA clones were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( HZF 1 - 42 ) of which only 8 have previously been described .",,,
 Northern blot analysis showed that a majority of these genes were expressed at comparable levels in U-937 and HeLa cells .,expressed;,12;,Gene_expression;
 The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non-cell-type-specific expression suggest that the majority of the Kruppel-related zinc finger genes are likely to be expressed in most human tissues .,expression;,16;,Gene_expression;

 Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 cDNAs ( HZF 1 - 10 ) and a partial characterization of HZF 11 - 42 revealed that a common feature of human Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins is the presence of tandem arrays of zinc fingers ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the carboxy-terminal regions of the proteins .,,,
" In addition , several novel KRAB-containing zinc finger genes and a novel conserved sequence element were identified .",,,
 Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II downregulates both calcineurin and protein kinase C-mediated pathways for cytokine gene transcription in human T cells .,,,
 Engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen activates phospholipase C resulting in an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) .,,,
" Increased [Ca2+]i activates Ca2+/ calmodulin - dependent kinases including the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaM-K II ) , as well as calcineurin , a type 2B protein phosphatase .",,,
 Recent studies have identified calcineurin as a key enzyme for interleukin ( IL ) -2 and IL-4 promoter activation .,activation;,19;,Positive_regulation;

 Cotransfection of gamma B*CaM-K with the IL-2 promoter construct downregulated its transcription in response to stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .,,,

 HIV-1 Nef leads to inhibition or activation of T cells depending on its intracellular localization .,localization;,15;,Localization;
 Nef of primate lentiviruses is required for viremia and progression to AIDS in monkeys .,,,

 The regulation of HIV by retinoic acid correlates with cellular expression of the retinoic acid receptors .,,,
 OBJECTIVES : To analyze the effect of retinoic acids ( RA ) on HIV-1 expression and correlate this effect with expression levels of RA receptors ( RARs ) in T-lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines .,,,
" DESIGN AND METHODS : The effect of all-trans and 9-cis RA on HIV-1 production in T-lymphoid ( H9 , CEM ) and monocytoid ( U937,THP-1 ) cell lines was measured during acute and chronic infection .",,,
" The expression levels of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha , receptor for all-trans RA ) and the human retinoid-X receptor alpha ( hRXR alpha receptor for 9-cis RA ) were determined by Northern blot analysis .",expression;receptor;receptor;receptor;,2;12;21;26;,Gene_expression;Binding;Binding;Binding;
" RESULTS : Both all-trans and 9-cis RA inhibited virus replication in HIV-1 IIIB-infected monocytoid cells , in the presence and absence of the co-stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .",,,
 The retinoids had weak or no stimulatory effects on HIV production by T-cell lines .,,,
 HIV production by PMA-stimulated T-cell lines was inhibited by these retinoids .,,,
 The 9-cis RA was generally more effective than all-trans RA in inhibiting HIV production and in combination generally more effective than the single agents alone .,,,
" Human RAR alpha was expressed in H9 , U937 and THP-1 cells , but almost undetectable in CEM cells .",,,
" Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells , weakly expressed in H9 cells and not detectable in CEM cells .",expressed;expressed;detectable;,6;14;20;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

" Human RAR alpha expression was unchanged in H9 and CEM cells , and elevated in U937 cells , after PMA stimulation .",expression;unchanged;elevated;,4;6;14;,Gene_expression;Regulation;Positive_regulation;
 CONCLUSION : The effect of RA on HIV-1 expression was cell-type-dependent and partially correlated with cellular expression of RARs .,,,
 Endogenous or exogenously administered RA may have a significant role in HIV regulation .,,,
 Identification of human TR2 orphan receptor response element in the transcriptional initiation site of the simian virus 40 major late promoter [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1995 Nov 3;270(44):26721 ],,,
" A DNA response element ( TR2RE-SV40 ) for the TR2 orphan receptor , a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) +55 region ( nucleotide numbers 368-389 , 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3' ) .",,,
" Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence .",,,
 DNA-swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE-SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the androgen receptor .,,,
" In addition , this TR2RE-SV40 can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters .",,,
" Together , these data suggest the TR2RE-SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression .",,,
 Mapping of the interaction site of the defective transcription factor in the class II major histocompatibility complex mutant cell line clone-13 to the divergent X2-box .,,,
" We have previously described a mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line , Clone-13 , that expresses HLA-DQ in the absence of HLA-DR and -DP .",,,
 Several criteria indicated that the defect in this cell line influences the activity of an isotype-specific transcription factor .,,,
" Indeed , transient transfection of HLA-DRA and DQB reporter constructs indicated that the affected factor operates via cis-elements located between -141 base pairs and the transcription initiation site .",,,
 A series of hybrid DRA/DQB reporter constructs was generated to further map the relevant cis-elements in this system .,,,
 Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB X-box ( but not the DQB-W region or the DQB Y-box ) upstream of -141 in a DRA reporter plasmid rescued expression to nearly wild-type levels .,,,
" Substitution promoters were then generated where the entire X-box , or only the X1- or X2-boxes of HLA-DRA were replaced with the analogous regions of HLA-DQB .",,,
 The DQB X2-box was able to restore expression to the silent DRA reporter construct .,,,
" Moreover , replacement of the DQB X2-box with the DRA X2-box markedly diminished the activity of the DQB promoter in the mutant cell .",,,
" None of the hybrid reporter constructs were defective when transfected into the wild-type , HLA-DR/-DQ positive parental cell line , Jijoye .",,,
 These studies suggest that the divergent X2-box of the class II major histocompatibility complex promoters plays an important role in influencing differential expression of the human class II isotypes .,,,

 Effects of CD45 on NF-kappa B .,,,
 Implications for replication of HIV-1 .,,,
 Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of infected T cells through the TCR .,,,
" However , anti - CD45 antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals .",,,
" In this study , we examined interrelationships between CD45 and HIV-1 further .",,,
 We measured effects on the HIV-1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that lacked the expression of CD45 on their surfaces .,expression;,25;,Gene_expression;
" First , anti - CD45 antibodies did not affect basal but decreased activated levels of expression from the HIV-1 LTR .",,,
" Second , T cells , which lack CD45 and can not signal via the TCR , supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression .",lack;,7;,Negative_regulation;
 This was due to the presence of active NF-kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45 - T cells .,,,
" Additionally , infected T cells displayed lower levels of CD45 on their surfaces .",,,
" Thus , CD45 plays an active role in the physiology of T cells and in the replication of HIV-1 .",,,
" ERP , a new member of the ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family : cloning , characterization , and differential expression during B-lymphocyte development .",expression;,19;,Gene_expression;
" The ets gene family encodes a group of proteins which function as transcription factors under physiological conditions and , if aberrantly expressed , can cause cellular transformation .",,,
" We have recently identified two regulatory elements in the murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer , pi and microB , which exhibit striking similarity to binding sites for ets-related proteins .",,,
" To identify ets-related transcriptional regulators expressed in pre-B lymphocytes that may interact with either the pi or the microB site , we have used a PCR approach with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved sequences in all members of the ets family .",,,
" We have cloned the gene for a new ets-related transcription factor , ERP ( ets-related protein ) , from the murine pre-B cell line BASC 6C2 and from mouse lung tissue .",,,
 The ERP protein contains a region of high homology with the ETS DNA-binding domain common to all members of the ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family .,,,
" Three additional smaller regions show homology to the ELK-1 and SAP-1 genes , a subgroup of the ets gene family that interacts with the serum response factor .",interacts;,22;,Binding;
 Full-length ERP expresses only negligible DNA - binding activity by itself .,,,
" Removal of the carboxy terminus enables ERP to interact with a variety of ets-binding sites including the E74 site , the IgH enhancer pi site , and the lck promoter ets site , suggesting a carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain .",enables;interact;,6;9;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
 At least three ERP - related transcripts are expressed in a variety of tissues .,,,
" However , within the B-cell lineage , ERP is highly expressed primarily at early stages of B-lymphocyte development , and expression declines drastically upon B-cell maturation , correlating with the enhancer activity of the IgH pi site .",expressed;declines;,11;22;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
 These data suggest that ERP might play a role in B-cell development and in IgH gene regulation .,,,
 Pentoxifylline for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus .,,,
 Cytokine dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection has been documented in numerous studies and has been cited as an important component in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection .,,,
" Pharmacological modification of cytokine dysregulation , therefore , has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection .",,,
" Dr. Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital ( Boston ) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , a cytokine known to influence HIV-1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus .",effects;expression;,19;23;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
" Pentoxifylline , a trisubstituted xanthine derivative , has been used to decrease blood viscosity and is reasonably well tolerated by most recipients of the drug .",,,

 Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes activate NF-kappa B .,,,
" We have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1 , gp160 can induce activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappa B .",,,
" The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule , since pretreatment with soluble CD4 abrogates its activity .",,,
" The gp160 - induced NF-kappa B complex consists of p65 , p50 and c-rel proteins .",induced;complex;,4;7;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" The stimulatory effect of gp160 on NF-kappa B activation is protein synthesis independent , is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and abrogated by inhibitors of protein kinase C .",,,

 Role of HIV-1 Nef expression in activation pathways in CD4 + T cells .,expression;,5;,Gene_expression;

" Secretion of IL-2 and TNF-alpha , surface expression of IL-2R , and DNA - binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 ( Fos / Jun ) complex in response to phorbol myristate acetate , TNF-alpha , or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored .",Secretion;response;,1;29;,Localization;Positive_regulation;
" These parameters were not modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef + Jurkat cells .",modified;expression;,5;8;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 This inhibition was not mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP - binding activity because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition .,phosphorylation;,8;,Phosphorylation;
 Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was not mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity but through the region containing the negative responding elements ( NREs ) .,,,
 These results suggest that Nef downmodulates LTR activation without significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations .,,,

" The NM23 gene has been proposed as a metastasis-suppressor gene , and its use has been suggested as prognostic factor .",,,
" NM23 was identified in a system of murine melanoma cell lines , in which an inverse relationship was found between NM23 expression and metastatic ability .",,,
 In a human malignant melanoma study NM23 expression was found to be significantly lower in metastases that developed less than 24 months after diagnosis of the primary tumours .,,,

 The level of mRNA expression of the NM23 gene is significantly lower in cell lines that derive from more infiltrating primary melanomas than in cell lines obtained from less infiltrating tumours .,,,
" Moreover , cell lines derived from tumours of patients with a disease-free survival of more than 24 months ( 24-58 months ) express the NM23 gene at higher levels than cell lines obtained from melanomas of patients with a disease-free survival of less than 24 months ( 6-15 months ) .",,,
 T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B-specific DNA-binding activity : a preliminary report .,,,
 Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .,,,
 We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity .,,,
" The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .",,,
 The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .,,,
" On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B/Rel family proteins , the kappa B - binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit .",,,
" The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex , was not induced in the nucleus following activation .",induced;,37;,Positive_regulation;
 Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells .,detect;,6;,Localization;
 The altered kappa B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli .,,,
 Activation of NF-kappa B in vivo is regulated by multiple phosphorylations .,,,
 The activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) in intact cells is mechanistically not well understood .,,,
 Therefore we investigated the modifications imposed on NF-kappa B/I kappa B components following stimulation and show that the final step of NF-kappa B induction in vivo involves phosphorylation of several members of the NF-kappa B/I kappa B protein families .,,,
" In HeLa cells as well as in B cells , TNF-alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of p50 - p65 , but not of c-rel .",induced;translocation;,13;15;,Positive_regulation;Localization;

" Surprisingly , even p65 , but not c-rel , was phosphorylated after induction in vivo , suggesting that TNF-alpha selectively activates only specific NF-kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF-kappa B molecules .",phosphorylated;induction;,11;13;,Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;
" In fact , cellular NF-kappa B activity was phosphorylation-dependent and the DNA binding activity of p65 - containing NF-kappa B was enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro .",enhanced;,22;,Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , we found that the induction by hydrogen peroxide of NF-kappa B translocation to the nucleus , which is assumed to be triggered by reactive oxygen intermediates , also coincided with incorporation of phosphate into the same subunits that were modified after stimulation by TNF-alpha .",,,
" Thus , phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for activation of NF-kappa B in vivo .",,,
 An active v-abl protein tyrosine kinase blocks immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement .,,,
 Lymphoid cells transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus have provided one of the classic models for study of early B-cell development and immunoglobulin rearrangement .,,,
" Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but not their light chain genes , suggesting that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step .",,,
" To test this hypothesis , light-chain gene structure was examined in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL-2 gene .",express;,33;,Gene_expression;

" As documented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) , an active v-abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF-kappa B/rel and expression controlled by the kappa intron enhancer .",,,
 Together these data demonstrate that the v-abl protein specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B-cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression .,,,
 [ An overexpression of retinoic acid receptor alpha blocks myeloid cell differentiation at the promyelocyte stage ],overexpression;,3;,Gene_expression;
" Retinoic acid ( RA ) , a vitamin A derivative , exerts a wide range of biological effects related to cell proliferation and differentiation .",,,
 The pleiotropic effects of RA are thought to be mediated through specific nuclear RA receptors ( RARs ) .,,,
 RARs are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and exhibit a molecular structure that possess discrete DNA-binding and RA (ligand)-binding domains .,,,
" In hematopoietic system , RA and RARs , predominantly RAR alpha may play key roles for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors .",,,
" However , it is currently unknown how RA and RARs are involved in regulating normal hematopoietic differentiation .",,,
" To make clear the roles of RA and RAR alpha in the normal hematopoiesis , I have introduced the construct of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha ) into murine bone marrow cells with retroviral vector , and selected infected cells with drug resistant marker ( Neo(r) ) cultured on the stroma cell line ( PA6-neo ) , and analyzed the behavior of infected cells .",,,
 All of procedure were done in vitro .,,,
 Most cells infected with hRAR alpha exhibited promyelocytic morphology and were thought to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage in their myeloid differentiation .,,,
" Furthermore , these immature cells differentiated terminally into mature granulocytes by adding with RA ( 10(-6) M ) .",,,
 RAR alpha infected cells were also able to differentiate into mature macrophages in the both of long term culture and IL3 colony .,,,
 These observations suggest that an overexpression of RAR alpha alone is effective to suppress myeloid cell differentiation and RAR alpha plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of myeloid precursors .,overexpression;,6;,Positive_regulation;
 The system described here may serve as a model for studying the the essential genes for differentiation of normal bone marrow cells .,,,

 A family of serine proteases expressed exclusively in myelo-monocytic cells specifically processes the nuclear factor-kappa B subunit p65 in vitro and may impair human immunodeficiency virus replication in these cells .,,,
 Two groups of U937 promonocytic cells were obtained by limiting dilution cloning which differed strikingly in their ability to support human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication .,,,
" "" Plus "" clones replicated the virus efficiently , whereas "" minus "" clones did not .",,,
 We examined these clones for differences in nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activity which might account for the observed phenomenon .,,,

 The tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a potent transcriptional activator that both stimulates viral gene expression and activates an array of cellular genes involved in T-cell growth .,,,

 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),,,
 Arrested development : understanding v-abl .,,,
 The protein tyrosine kinase activity of the v-abl oncogene has been demonstrated to subvert the normal second messenger systems used by lymphoid cells for growth and differentiation .,,,
 Transformation of bone marrow with the Abelson murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of B cell lineage cells arrested at the pre-B cell stage .,,,
 Recent reports have characterized these cells expressing high v-abl kinase activity as deficient in detectable NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and low level RAG gene expression .,,,
 These observations suggest that v-abl may be inhibiting the differentiation of B cells by blocking these two crucial elements in the maturation pathway .,,,

 Functions of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in immunology and immunopathology .,,,
 Even a moderate increase in the cellular cysteine supply elevates the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) and glutathione disulfide ( GSSG ) levels and potentiates immunological functions of lymphocytes in vitro .,,,
" At low GSSG levels , T cells can not optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B .",,,
 The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced thioredoxin ( TRX ) .,,,
" As the protein tyrosine kinase activities p56lck and p59fyn are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide , they are likely targets for GSSG action .",activated;targets;,11;22;,Positive_regulation;Regulation;
" These redox-regulated enzymes trigger signal cascades for NF kappa B activation and transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor , from CD4 and CD8 molecules , and from the IL-2 receptor beta-chain .",,,
 The effector phase of cytotoxic T cell responses and IL-2 - dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool .,,,
" As signal transduction is facilitated by prooxidant conditions , we propose that the well-known immunological consequences of GSH depletion ultimately may be results of the accompanying GSSG deficiency .",,,
" As HIV-infected patients and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , significantly decreased plasma cyst(e)ine and intracellular GSH levels , we also hypothesize that AIDS may be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well .",,,
 Erythropoietin - dependent induction of hemoglobin synthesis in a cytokine-dependent cell line M-TAT .,,,
 M-TAT is a cytokine-dependent cell line with the potential to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .,,,
" We cultured M-TAT cells long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , or stem cell factor ( SCF ) .",,,
" These long term cultures are referred to as M-TAT/EPO , M-TAT/GM-CSF , and M-TAT/SCF cells , respectively .",,,
 Hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M-TAT / EPO cells than in M-TAT / GM-CSF cells .,levels;,10;,Transcription;

" In contrast , the addition of GM-CSF to the M-TAT / EPO cell culture decreased the amount of hemoglobin , even in the presence of EPO , indicating that the EPO signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by GM-CSF .",,,
" Thus , erythroid development of M-TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM-CSF .",,,
 These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation .,,,
" One gene , two transcripts : isolation of an alternative transcript encoding for the autoantigen La / SS-B from a cDNA library of a patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome .",,,
 A cDNA library was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of an autoimmune patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome .,,,
 The cDNA library was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the nuclear autoantigen La / SS-B .,,,
 Thereby an alternative type of La mRNA was identified that differed from the known La mRNA due to an exchange of the exon 1 .,,,
 Sequencing of the genomic region between the exons 1 and 2 showed that the alternative 5'-end is a part of the intron .,,,

 Functional Myc - Max heterodimer is required for activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas .,,,
" T cell hybridomas respond to activation signals by undergoing apoptotic cell death , and this is likely to represent comparable events related to tolerance induction in immature and mature T cells in vivo .",,,
 Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the c-Myc protein in the phenomenon of activation-induced apoptosis .,,,
" This role for c-Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , Max , which we show here inhibits activation-induced apoptosis .",,,

 Enhanced responsiveness to nuclear factor kappa B contributes to the unique phenotype of simian immunodeficiency virus variant SIVsmmPBj14 .,,,
" Infection with a variant of simian immunodeficiency virus , SIVsmmPBj14 , leads to severe acute disease in macaques .",,,
 This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of previously described mutations in the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and to elucidate their contribution to the unique phenotype of SIVsmmPBj14 .,,,
 LTR-directed transcription was measured by using luciferase reporter constructs that were transiently transfected into cultured cells .,,,
" In a wide range of cell types , the basal transcriptional activity of the LTR from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to be 2- to 4.5-fold higher than that of an LTR from a non-acutely pathogenic strain .",,,
" These LTRs differ by five point mutations and a 22-bp duplication in SIVsmmPBj14 , which includes a nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) site .",,,
 Transcriptional differences between these LTRs were further enhanced by two- to threefold upon treatment of cells with phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha or by cotransfection with plasmids expressing NF kappa B subunits .,,,
" Mutagenesis studies , and the use of a reporter construct containing an enhancerless promoter , indicate that these transcriptional effects are due principally to the 22-bp sequence duplication and the NF kappa B site contained within it .",,,
" Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic except for the LTR were generated .",,,
 The LTR from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to confer an increase in the kinetics of virus replication in cultured cells .,,,
 Inclusion of this LTR in recombinant SIVs also resulted in a two- to threefold rise in the extent of cellular proliferation that was induced in quiescent simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells .,,,
 These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that LTR mutations assist SIVsmmPBj14 in responding efficiently to cellular stimulation and allow it to replicate to high titers during the acute phase of viral infection .,,,
 Identification of a region which directs the monocytic activity of the colony-stimulating factor 1 ( macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) receptor promoter and binds PEBP2/CBF ( AML1 ) .,directs;binds;,6;23;,Regulation;Binding;
 The receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( or colony-stimulating factor 1 [ CSF-1 ] ) is expressed from different promoters in monocytic cells and placental trophoblasts .,,,
" We have demonstrated that the monocyte-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor is regulated at the level of transcription by a tissue-specific promoter whose activity is stimulated by the monocyte/B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 ( D.-E.Zhang , C.J.Hetherington , H.-M.Chen , and D.G.Tenen , Mol.Cell.

 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that region II interacts specifically with nuclear proteins from monocytic cells .,,,
 Two gel shift complexes ( Mono A and Mono B ) were formed with separate sequence elements within this region .,,,

 A novel DNA sequence element termed the J element involved in the regulated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes was recently described .,,,
" To study this element and its role in class II gene regulation further , a cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the S element and the nearby J element of the human DPA gene .",,,

 Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells .,,,
 The induction of cell death in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of apoptosis .,,,
 Although the exact mechanism by which apoptosis occurs in lymphocytes is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids .,,,
" The role of chromatin degradation and endonucleases in the apoptotic process has been closely studied , as well as the involvement of several oncogenes in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis .",,,

" Replacement of the NF-kappa B elements in the HIV-1 LTR by a DNA fragment derived from the 5'-flanking region of IFN-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , containing the IFN-stimulated response element , partially restored Tat - mediated activation of LTR in T cells as well as in monocytes .",,,

" Treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL-60 , with 10 micrograms/mL etoposide or 2 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced NF-kappa B activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3-4 hr .",,,
 The simultaneous addition of 50-500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked NF-kappa B activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr .,,,
" However , PDTC failed to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates .",,,
 The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in human thymocytes at a concentration of 1-10 microM .,,,
" Since PDTC has both antioxidant and metal-ion chelating activities , we tested the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) ( antioxidant ) or o-phenanthroline ( OP ) ( metal-ion chelator ) on the induction of apoptosis .",,,

 Constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B in cells of the monocyte lineage .,,,
" In monocytes , the nuclear factor NF-kappa B has been invoked as an important transcription factor in the expression of cytokine genes , of cell-surface receptors and in the expression of human immunodeficiency virus .",,,
" In such cells , DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B can be detected without intentional stimulation .",,,
" In our studies , cells of the human monocytic line Mono Mac 6 , cultured in medium containing fetal-calf serum and low levels of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , also exhibit such ' constitutive ' NF-kappa B , as demonstrated by mobility-shift analysis of nuclear extracts .",,,
 This nuclear NF-kappa B was still present when contaminant LPS was removed by ultrafiltration and when serum was omitted .,,,
 Protein-DNA complexes of constitutive NF-kappa B are similar in mobility to the LPS-induced NF-kappa B and both are recognized by an antibody specific to the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B .,,,
" By contrast , treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) will only block LPS-induced NF-kappa B , but not the constitutive binding protein .",,,

" When ordered according to stage of maturation , the amount of constitutive NF-kappa B was not increased in more mature cell lines .",,,

" Analysis of primary cells revealed substantial constitutive NF-kappa B-binding activity in blood monocytes , pleural macrophages and alveolar macrophages .",,,
" The constitutive NF-kappa B appears to be functionally active , since a low level of tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) transcript is detectable in monocytes , and this level can be increased by blocking transcript degradation using cycloheximide .",,,
 The level of constitutive NF-kappa B in these cells is variable and is frequently found to be lower in the more mature macrophages .,,,

 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ),,,
 Function and activation of NF-kappa B in the immune system .,,,
 NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor .,,,
" Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system .",,,
" Among these properties are NF-kappa B 's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins .",,,
" In vertebrates , five distinct DNA binding subunits are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize , thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity , DNA sequence specificity , and cell type- and cell stage-specific distribution .",,,
 The activity of DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates .,,,
 I kappa B proteins inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of NF-kappa B complexes .,,,
 An exception is the Bcl-3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in th nucleus .,,,
 Other I kappa B proteins are rather involved in terminating NF-kappa B 's activity in the nucleus .,,,
" The intracellular events that lead to the inactivation of I kappa B , i.e. the activation of NF-kappa B , are complex .",,,
 They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells ' redox status .,,,
" Interference with the activation or activity of NF-kappa B may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock , graft-vs-host reactions , acute inflammatory reactions , acute phase response , and radiation damage .",,,
 The inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes .,,,

 Effects of prostaglandin E2 on Th0-type human T cell clones : modulation of functions of nuclear proteins involved in cytokine production .,,,
 The effects of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) on cytokine production and proliferation of the CD4 + human helper T cell clone SP-B21 were investigated .,,,

" Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems , the rate-limiting step in peripheral T cells has not been demonstrated .",,,
" To model effective versus ineffective CD3-mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells , we used two anti-CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells : OKT3 , which causes early second messenger generation but is unable to activate T cells without a second signal , and 64.1 , which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own .",,,
 We found that tyrosine kinase activity was similar for both mAbs over a period of hours .,,,

 Activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human neuroblastoma cell lines .,,,
 The nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a eukaryotic transcription factor .,,,
" In B cells and macrophages it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , NF-kappa B translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals .",,,

 The TNF alpha - activated NF-kappa B was transcriptionally functional .,,,
 NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha was not correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation .,,,
" However , reagents such as nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which induce phenotypical differentiation of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line , activated NF-kappa B , but only in that particular cell line .",,,
" In a NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line , PC12 , PMA activated NF-kappa B , whereas NGF did not .",,,
" In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such as SK-N-Be(2) , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated with the lack of NF-kappa B activation .",,,
" We found , moreover , that in SK-N-Be(2) cells protein kinase C ( PKC ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a control cell line and that the low PKC enzymatic activity was due to low PKC protein expression .",,,
" NF-kappa B was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study .",,,

 Genes encoding general initiation factors for RNA polymerase II transcription are dispersed in the human genome .,,,
 General transcription factors are required for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II .,,,
 Human cDNAs encoding subunits of these factors have been cloned and sequenced .,,,
" Using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , we show here that the genes encoding the TATA-box binding protein ( TBP ) , TFIIB , TFIIE alpha , TFIIE beta , RAP30 , RAP74 and the 62 kDa subunit , of TFIIH are located at the human chromosomal bands 6q26-27 , 1p21-22 , 3q21-24 , 8p12 , 13q14 , 19p13.3 and 11p14-15.1 , respectively .",,,

 A novel heterodimerization partner for thyroid hormone receptor .,,,
 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor .,,,
 Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors .,,,
" In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .",,,
" Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .",,,
" However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but not the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR+2 ) .",,,
 The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .,,,
" Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .",,,

 Function of NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites in the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain promoter is dependent on cell-specific binding of different NF-kappa B/Rel subunits .,Function;dependent;,1;18;,Regulation;Regulation;
 The promoter of the human major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant-chain gene ( Ii ) contains two NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites located at -109 to -118 ( Ii kappa B-1 ) and -163 to -172 ( Ii kappa B-2 ) from the transcription start site .,,,
 We report here that the differential function of each of these NF-kappa B/Rel sites in several distinct cell types depends on cell-specific binding of NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors .,,,
" Ii kappa B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and in the Ii-expressing T-cell line , H9 , but acts as a negative regulatory element in myelomonocytic and glia cell lines .",,,
 In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at Ii kappa B-1 in cell lines in which this site is functional as either a positive or negative regulator .,,,
" Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA - binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with negative regulation .",presence;,45;,Binding;
" Ii kappa B-2 is a site of positive regulation in B-cell lines and a site of negative regulation in H9 T cells , myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines .",,,
 In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the H9 T-cell line .,,,

 Analyses with cultured cells and cell-free systems have provided strong evidence that GATA-1 is involved in control of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .,,,
 Targeted mutagenesis of the GATA-1 gene in embryonic stem cells has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development .,,,
" Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact GATA element in the distal promoter , suggesting autoregulatory control of GATA-1 transcription .",transcription;,21;,Transcription;

 Activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human lymphoblastoid cells by low-dose ionizing radiation .,,,
 Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a pleiotropic transcription factor which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several specific genes .,,,
 Recent reports demonstrated that ionizing radiation in the dose range of 2-50 Gy results in expression of NF-kappa B in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells and human B-lymphocyte precursor cells ; the precise mechanism involved and the significance are not yet known .,,,
" The present report demonstrates that even lower doses of ionizing radiation , 0.25-2.0 Gy , are capable of inducing expression of NF-kappa B in EBV-transformed 244B human lymphoblastoid cells .",,,
 These results are in a dose range where the viability of the cells remains very high .,,,

 Central nervous system-derived cells express a kappa B-binding activity that enhances human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in vitro and facilitates TAR-independent transactivation by Tat .,,,
 The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat-directed transcription .,,,

" All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is an important morphogen in vertebrate development , a normal constituent in human adult blood and is also involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia .",,,
 We have examined the effects of RA on normal hematopoiesis by using early hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) stringently purified from adult peripheral blood .,,,
" In clonogenetic fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS+ ) or -nonsupplemented ( FCS- ) culture treated with saturating levels of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Ep ) ( combined with c-kit ligand in FCS(-)-culture conditions ) , RA induces a dramatic dose-dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation , the latter colonies being essentially represented by granulocytic clones .",,,
" This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon , because in FCS+ culture , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition .",,,
" In FCS- liquid-suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and low-dose IL-3 / GM-CSF , adult HPC undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation : Here again , treatment with high-dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .",,,
" Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective , thus indicating that early but not late HPC are sensitive to its action .",,,
" We then analyzed the expression of the master GATA1 gene , which encodes a finger transcription factor required for normal erythroid development ; addition of RA to HPC stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of GATA1 mRNA induction .",expression;inhibition;induction;,5;41;45;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" These results indicate that RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult HPC , and may lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .",,,
 This phenomenon is correlated with inhibition of GATA1 induction in the early stages of erythropoietic differentiation .,inhibition;induction;,6;9;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Comparative analysis of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) complex in human T and B lymphocytes .,,,
 Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a transcriptional activator that binds to sequences in the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter and is thought to be largely responsible for the T cell-specific inducibility of IL-2 expression .,binds;responsible;inducibility;expression;,15;31;36;39;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that specific NFAT binding activity could also be induced in human B cells .,induced;,17;,Positive_regulation;
" The B cell NFAT complex , however , was not functional , since it failed to activate transcription from an NFAT-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct .",activate;transcription;,17;18;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
" Competition with an AP-1 motif or with anti-Jun and anti-Fos antibodies abolished binding to the NFAT motif in both T and B cells , indicating that Jun and Fos are critical for NFAT complex formation in both cell types .",,,
 Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif .,,,
" However , when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts , full-length , but not truncated , Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an NFAT complex , indicating the presence of a constitutively expressed nuclear factor(s) in B and T cells necessary for the formation of the NFAT complex in both cell types .",,,
 An NFAT oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the 5' purine-rich part of the NFAT sequence failed to form a complex and to compete with the wild type motif for NFAT complex formation in both T and B cells .,,,
" We therefore propose a model whereby a core NFAT complex consisting of Jun , Fos , and a constitutive nuclear factor is formed in both T and B cells , but an additional factor and/or post-translational modification of a factor , missing in B cells , might be required for transactivation by NFAT .",,,
 Differential autoregulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression in human T- and B-cell lines .,autoregulation;expression;,2;6;,Regulation;Gene_expression;

" In contrast to the decrease in GR mRNA seen in IM-9 cells after treatment with 1 microM dexamethasone for 16-18 h , treatment of 6TG1.1 cells resulted in an 8-fold increase in GR mRNA , as determined by Northern blot and RNase protection analysis , with a corresponding 3- to 4-fold increase in GR protein .",decrease;increase;increase;,5;31;52;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Half-maximal induction of GR mRNA and protein in 6TG1.1 cells was observed between 10-100 nM dexamethasone , and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone , demonstrating that positive autoregulation of GR expression in 6TG1.1 cells is a receptor-mediated response .",induction;blocked;expression;,2;26;40;,Transcription;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Positive autoregulation of GR expression was also observed in glucocorticoid-resistant CEM-C1 cells , which contain functional GR , but whose growth is unaffected by glucocorticoids .",expression;,5;,Gene_expression;
" Thus , positive autoregulation is neither a consequence nor the sole cause of growth arrest .",consequence;,8;,Positive_regulation;
 The degree of negative autoregulation in IM-9 cells and positive autoregulation in 6TG1.1 cells was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide .,unaffected;,16;,Regulation;

 Occurrence of a silencer of the interleukin-2 gene in naive but not in memory resting T helper lymphocytes .,,,
 In the immune system the first activation of a naive T cell by antigen is a key step in the shaping of the peripheral T cell specificity repertoire and maintenance of self-tolerance .,,,
" In the present study , analysis of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene activation shows that naive human helper T cells ( cord blood CD4 + T cells , adult CD4 + CD45 RO- T cells ) regulate IL-2 transcription by a mechanism involving both a silencer and an activator acting on the purine-rich IL-2 promoter elements ( NF-AT binding sites ) .",activation;regulate;transcription;acting;,14;38;40;51;,Positive_regulation;Regulation;Transcription;Regulation;
" By contrast , memory cells , either in vitro activated helper T cells reverting to a resting state , or CD4 + T ( memory ) clones , or CD4 + CD45 RO+ T cells isolated ex vivo , no longer have a silencer .",,,
" Their IL-2 transcription seems to be controlled solely by the transition from inactive to active functional state of a positive transcription factor binding to these promoter elements as well as its cytoplasmic or nuclear location : in resting memory T cells the activator is located in the cytoplasm and is inactive , whereas in stimulated cells it is functional in promoting transcription and now resides in the nucleus .",transcription;controlled;transcription;binding;transcription;,3;7;21;23;62;,Transcription;Regulation;Transcription;Binding;Transcription;
" Thus , the regulation of the gene coding for the main T cell growth factor changes irreversibly after the first encounter of T cells with antigen .",,,
 It is most likely that the presence of a silencer contributes to the more stringent activation requirements of naive CD4 + T cells .,,,
 Stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta production in human monocytes by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors .,Stimulation;production;inhibitors;,1;8;18;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
 Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates .,,,
" In human monocytes , the inhibitors of these phosphatases , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 alpha .",inhibitors;increase;,6;20;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes .,,,
" Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities , including those of AP-1 , by these protein phosphatase inhibitors .",stimulation;,11;,Positive_regulation;
 Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 beta precursor and mature forms and their secretion .,increased;secretion;,3;16;,Positive_regulation;Localization;
 This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation .,stimulation;accumulation;,9;15;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 The stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin-1 beta .,stimulation;production;,2;6;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" However , the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine was increased .",phosphorylation;increased;,4;12;,Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;
 These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production .,,,
 Human CD3 - CD16 + natural killer cells express the hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor and an unrearranged 2.3-kb TcR delta transcript .,express;,9;,Gene_expression;
 In this study we analyzed the T cell receptor(TcR) delta transcripts expressed by CD3 - CD16 + cells and we investigated whether these cells expressed the hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor and the recombination-activating gene ( RAG ) -1 .,expressed;expressed;,12;25;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Multiple TcR delta transcripts deriving from an unrearranged TcR delta gene were detected in both polyclonal and clonal CD3 - CD16 + natural killer(NK) cell lines .,deriving;,5;,Transcription;
 Two unrearranged TcR delta transcripts had a size similar to that of the functional TcR delta mRNA ( 2.3 and 1.3 kb ) found in TcR gamma / delta + T lymphocytes .,found;,24;,Transcription;
 Sequence analysis of nine different 2.3-kb cDNA clones obtained from NK-derived polyA+ RNA confirmed that they corresponded to an unrearranged TcR delta gene .,,,
 These cDNA were 2343 bp long and their transcription initiation site was located 814 bp upstream from the J delta 1 segment .,,,
 The sequence located upstream of the J delta 1 segment corresponded to the previously reported germ-line sequence .,,,
 The J delta 1 segment was correctly spliced to C delta ; in addition the four C delta exons were found to be already assembled .,,,
 Two polyadenylation sites were present in the fourth C delta exon .,,,
" However , only that located at the 3' end appeared to be utilized in the 2.3-kb cDNA .",,,
" The expression of hGATA-3 , a T cell-specific factor known to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of TcR delta locus , was analyzed by Northern blot , in cultured NK cell population and clones ( but not in freshly derived cell populations ) .",expression;transcription;,2;19;,Gene_expression;Transcription;

" Finally , no transcription of the RAG-1 gene could be detected in all NK cell lines or clones analyzed .",transcription;,4;,Transcription;
 Involvement of Alu sequences in the cell-specific regulation of transcription of the gamma chain of Fc and T cell receptors .,,,
 The Fc epsilon RI-gamma chains are expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells where they play a critical role in signal transduction .,expressed;,7;,Gene_expression;
" They are part of the high affinity IgE receptor in mast cells , basophils , Langerhans cells , and possibly other cells ; a component of the low affinity receptor for IgG ( Fc gamma RIIIA or CD16 ) in natural killer cells and macrophages ; and part of the T cell antigen receptor in subsets of T cells .",,,
 Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the gamma chain gene by analyzing the 2.5-kilobase sequence upstream of the transcription start site .,,,
 This sequence contains a promoter specific to cells of hematopoietic lineage .,,,
" However , the tissue specificity of this promoter is only partial because it is active in all of the hematopoietic cells tested here , regardless of whether they constitutively express Fc epsilon RI- gamma chain transcripts .",express;,30;,Transcription;
" We have identified two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements , both of which are part of an Alu repeat .",,,
 The first ( -445/-366 ) is a positive element active in both basophils and T cells .,,,
" The second ( -365/-264 ) binds to nuclear factors , which appear to be different in basophils and T cells , and acts as a negative element in basophils and as a positive one in T cells .",,,
" Thus , this Alu repeat ( 90 % identical to Alu consensus sequences ) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator .",,,
" Interleukin-3 expression by activated T cells involves an inducible , T-cell-specific factor and an octamer binding protein .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;

 We have investigated the protein binding characteristics and functional importance of the ACT-1-activating region of the IL-3 promoter .,,,

 These characteristics make the ACT-1 site analogous to the activating ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter .,activating;,10;,Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , and despite a lack of sequence homology , the promoters of IL-3 and IL-2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes .",important;expression;,29;33;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 ras protein activity is essential for T-cell antigen receptor signal transduction .,,,
 In a Jurkat cell model of T-cell activation an interleukin-2 promoter/reporter gene construct was activated by antigen receptor agonism in combination with the lymphokine interleukin-1 .,,,
 Antigen receptor signals could be mimicked by suboptimal activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) with phorbol esters in combination with calcium mobilization by an ionophore .,,,
" In cotransfection experiments , oncogenic rats obviated the need for PKC stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or interleukin-1 .",,,
 Activated ras expression also replaced the requirement for PKC stimulation in activation of the T-cell transcription factor NF-AT .,,,
" A dominant inhibitory ras mutant specifically blocked antigen receptor agonism , indicating that ras activity is required for antigen receptor signaling .",,,
" In addition , an inhibitor of PKC blocked both activated ras and phorbol ester stimulation , suggesting a role for ras upstream of PKC .",,,
 Characterization of the nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the lymphoid-specific nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) complex .,,,
" The lymphoid-specific transcription complex , NF-AT , is involved in early gene activation in T cells and is assembled from a pre-existing , T cell restricted cytoplasmic factor and an inducible ubiquitous nuclear component within 30 min after activation through the antigen receptor .",,,
 Recent studies have implicated the family of AP1 factors as components of the murine NF-AT complex .,,,
 Evidence is provided here that the nuclear component of human NF-AT contains the phorbol ester-inducible transcription factor AP1 ( Jun/Fos ) .,,,
 We further characterize which AP1 family members can assume this role .,,,
 Antisera to Fos inhibits NF-AT DNA binding as does an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for AP1 .,,,
" Constitutive expression in vivo of Fos , and to a lesser extent Fra-1 , eliminates the requirement for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) stimulation , leaving NF-AT-directed transcription responsive to calcium ionophore alone .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
" Overexpression of cJun or JunD , but not JunB , also eliminates the requirement for PMA , indicating that many but not all Jun- and Fos-related proteins functionally activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in the presence of the cytoplasmic component .",Overexpression;,1;,Positive_regulation;
 NF-AT DNA binding can be reconstituted in vitro using semi-purified AP1 proteins mixed with cytosol from T lymphocytes .,,,
" Fos proteins are not needed for this reconstitution , and although JunB is not functional , it can participate in the NF-AT DNA binding complex .",,,
" Finally , we have partially purified the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT and show by elution and renaturation from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels that it has a molecular mass between 94 and 116 kDa and may have multiple differentially modified forms .",,,
 Protease treatment of nuclear extracts distinguishes between class II MHC X1 box DNA-binding proteins in wild-type and class II-deficient B cells .,,,
 The X box region is critical for directing the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes in B lymphocytes .,,,
" Although several class II promoter-specific DNA binding factors have been described , only the X box region factor , RFX , shows a genetic correlation with class II expression , being deficient in some B cell lines derived from patients with class II-deficient congenital immunodeficiency .",,,
" To further evaluate the role of X box DNA-binding proteins in class II gene expression , the role of the X box region was examined in both class II-positive and -negative lymphoid cells .",,,
" In addition to the wild-type B cell line Raji , two class II transcriptional mutant cell lines , SJO and RJ2.2.5 , and Jurkat , a class II negative T cell line , were examined .",,,
" In contrast to wild-type B cells , neither of the class II mutant cell lines could use the X box region to direct the expression of a transiently transfected reporter gene , indicating that the X box-dependent transcriptional pathway is defective in these cells .",,,
 The binding activity of the X1 box DNA-binding protein RFX was examined and found to be present in wild-type B cells and the mutant RJ2.2.5 but was absent in SJO and Jurkat .,,,
" However , other X1 box-specific activities were detected in all these cell lines .",,,
" To determine whether these different X1 box activities represented distinct DNA binding proteins or multimeric forms of the same factor(s) , protease treatment of the crude nuclear extracts followed by DNA-binding assays were carried out and demonstrated that B cell extracts contain at least two X1-specific factors .",,,
 One of these cleaved products ( band 1 pk ) correlates with RFX activity .,,,
 A similar comparison with protease-treated extracts prepared from Jurkat cells demonstrated the presence of the band 1pk activity despite an absence of the native RFX activity .,,,
" In contrast , protease treatment and analysis of SJO extracts showed no detectable levels of the band 1pk activity .",,,
" These results demonstrate that multiple X1 box-specific DNA-binding activities exist in all lymphoid cells , but the presence of an actively binding RFX species correlates with class II transcription .",,,

 A cell-type-independent lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -responsive enhancer element located between -3757 and -2729 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( cap site ) consisted of at least six discrete subregions which were essential to the maximal induction by LPS in transfected monocytes .,,,
 The enhancer also appeared to mediate phorbol myristate acetate induction in monocytes and IL-1 responsiveness in fibroblasts .,,,
" Deletion and base substitution mutations along with DNA binding studies demonstrated that the enhancer contained a minimum of three functional protein binding sequences , two of which appeared to be important for gene induction .",important;induction;,31;34;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

" The PILOT protein has a calculated M(r) of 42.6 kDa and contains three zinc fingers of the C2H2-type at the carboxyl-terminus which are highly homologous to the zinc finger regions of the transcription factors EGR1 , EGR2 , and pAT 133 .",,,
" In contrast to T cells , in fibroblasts PILOT gene expression requires only one signal ( PMA ) and is not affected by CyA .",expression;requires;affected;,11;12;22;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Regulation;
 This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2+ signal-dependent regulatory element obligatory for expression of some genes in T cells but not in fibroblasts .,,,
 This differential expression model will be valuable in the dissection of the dual signal pathway in T cells and the effects of CyA upon it .,,,
 Suppression of a cellular differentiation program by phorbol esters coincides with inhibition of binding of a cell-specific transcription factor ( NF-E2 ) to an enhancer element required for expression of an erythroid-specific gene .,,,
" Induction by hemin increases , while induction with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) represses , erythroid-specific gene expression in the human cell line K562 .",,,
 We analyzed the effects of hemin or TPA induction on the binding and activity of transcription factors at a regulatory element found within the transcriptional regulatory sequences of many erythroid-specific genes .,,,
 TPA induction increases the binding of ubiquitous AP-1 factors to this element .,,,
 TPA induction inhibits the binding of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 to this transcriptional control element .,,,
 Hemin induction of K562 cells does not facilitate the binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site .,,,
 Hemin induction appears to nonspecifically increase the expression of transiently transfected genes in K562 cells .,,,
" Beyond this nonspecific increase in gene expression , hemin induction acts to increase the activity of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 .",,,
" The divergent effects of hemin and TPA on gene expression in K562 cells are mediated , in part , by their contrasting effects on the transcription factor NF-E2 .",,,

 Transcriptional activation of human zeta 2 globin promoter by the alpha globin regulatory element ( HS-40 ) : functional role of specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes .,,,
 We studied the functional interaction between human embryonic zeta 2 globin promoter and the alpha globin regulatory element ( HS-40 ) located 40 kb upstream of the zeta 2 globin gene .,,,
" It was shown by transient expression assay that HS-40 behaved as an authentic enhancer for high-level zeta 2 globin promoter activity in K562 cells , an erythroid cell line of embryonic and/or fetal origin .",,,
" Although sequences located between -559 and -88 of the zeta 2 globin gene were dispensable for its expression on enhancerless plasmids , they were required for the HS-40 enhancer - mediated activity of the zeta 2 globin promoter .",dispensable;expression;required;mediated;activity;,15;18;25;31;32;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Regulation;
" Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this HS-40 enhancer - zeta 2 globin promoter interaction is mediated by the two GATA-1 factor binding motifs located at -230 and -104 , respectively .",,,
 The functional domains of HS-40 were also mapped .,,,
" Bal 31 deletion mapping data suggested that one GATA-1 motif , one GT motif , and two NF-E2/AP1 motifs together formed the functional core of HS-40 in the erythroid-specific activation of the zeta 2 globin promoter .",activation;,30;,Positive_regulation;
 Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that the enhancer function of one of the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs of HS-40 is mediated through its binding to NF-E2 but not AP1 transcription factor .,,,
" Finally , we did genomic footprinting of the HS-40 enhancer region in K562 cells , adult nucleated erythroblasts , and different nonerythroid cells .",,,
" All sequence motifs within the functional core of HS-40 , as mapped by transient expression analysis , appeared to bind a nuclear factor(s) in living K562 cells but not in nonerythroid cells .",,,
" On the other hand , only one of the apparently nonfunctional sequence motifs was bound with factors in vivo .",,,
" In comparison to K562 , nucleated erythroblasts from adult human bone marrow exhibited a similar but nonidentical pattern of nuclear factor binding in vivo at the HS-40 region .",,,
 These data suggest that transcriptional activation of human embryonic zeta 2 globin gene and the fetal/adult alpha globin genes is mediated by erythroid cell-specific and developmental stage-specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes which form at the enhancer ( HS-40 ) and the globin promoters .,transcriptional;activation;mediated;,5;6;21;,Transcription;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Ectopic expression of a conditional GATA-2 / estrogen receptor chimera arrests erythroid differentiation in a hormone-dependent manner .,,,
 The GATA factors are a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins in eukaryotes that share extensive homology in their DNA-binding domains .,,,
" One enigmatic aspect of GATA factor expression is that several GATA proteins , which ostensibly share the same DNA-binding site specificity , are coexpressed in erythroid cells .",,,
" To elucidate the roles of individual GATA factors in erythropoiesis , conditional alleles of GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 were prepared by fusing each of the factors to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( ER ) .",,,
 These GATA / ER chimeric factors were shown to be hormone-inducible trans-activating proteins in transient transfection assays .,,,
" When stably introduced into primary erythroblasts or conditionally transformed erythroid progenitors cells , exogenous GATA-2 / ER promoted proliferation and inhibited terminal differentiation in an estrogen-dependent manner .",,,
 These phenotypic effects are specifically attributable to the action of ectopically expressed GATA-2 / ER because erythroblasts expressing exogenous GATA-2 are constitutively arrested in differentiation and because erythroid progenitors expressing either Gal / ER or GATA-3 / ER do not display a hormone-responsive block in differentiation .,expressing;expressing;,18;30;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

 ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ),,,
 Protein kinase C-zeta mediates NF-kappa B activation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected monocytes .,,,
 The molecular mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in a major cell reservoir such as the macrophage remain unknown .,,,
 NF-kappa B is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the HIV long terminal repeat and is selectively activated following HIV infection of human macrophages .,,,
" Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate NF-kappa B activation in monocytes-macrophages is available , our previous work indicated that classical protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoenzymes were not involved in the HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation .",,,
" In this study , we have focused on atypical PKC isoenzymes .",,,
 PKC-zeta belongs to this family and is known to be an important step in NF-kappa B activation in other cell systems .,,,
" Immunoblotting experiments with U937 cells demonstrate that PKC-zeta is present in these cells , and its expression can be downmodulated by antisense oligonucleotides ( AO ) .",present;downmodulated;,10;20;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
 The HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation is selectively reduced by AO to PKC-zeta .,,,
" In addition , cotransfection of a negative dominant molecule of PKC-zeta ( PKC-zeta mut ) with NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes selectively inhibits the HIV- but not phorbol myristate acetate- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NF-kappa B .",cotransfection;,4;,Gene_expression;
 That PKC-zeta is specific in regulating NF-kappa B is concluded from the inability of PKC-zeta (mut) to interfere with the basal or phorbol myristate acetate-inducible CREB - or AP1-dependent transcriptional activity .,,,
" Lastly , we demonstrate a selective inhibition of p24 production by HIV-infected human macrophages when treated with AO to PKC-zeta .",,,
" Altogether , these results suggest that atypical PKC isoenzymes , including PKC-zeta , participate in the signal transduction pathways by which HIV infection results in the activation of NF-kappa B in human monocytic cells and macrophages .",,,
 Inhibition of NF-AT-dependent transcription by NF-kappa B : implications for differential gene expression in T helper cell subsets .,,,
" Activation of individual CD4 + T cells results in differential lymphokine expression : interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is preferentially produced by T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) cells , which are involved in cell-mediated immune responses , whereas IL-4 is synthesized by TH2 cells , which are essential for humoral immunity .",produced;synthesized;,21;43;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;

 Functional characterization of the murine homolog of the B cell-specific coactivator BOB.1 / OBF.1 .,,,

 Comparison of the deduced amino acids shows 88 % sequence identity between mouse and human BOB.1 / OBF.1 .,,,

" Atopy , which predisposes individuals to develop asthma , severe systemic anaphylaxis , and atopic dermatitis , is usually associated with dramatically elevated total serum IgE levels and is thought to be controlled by a major susceptibility gene and multiple minor susceptibility genes .",,,
 A recent sib-pair analysis revealed a tight linkage between markers on 5q31.1 and a major susceptibility gene controlling total serum IgE levels .,,,
" Due to its location within this cluster and its biologic role in Ig class switching and Th2 cell differentiation , the IL-4 gene has emerged as one major candidate for the atopy gene .",,,

" In this study , we investigated the effects of IL-10 on the activation of HIV-1 from infected monocytes and macrophages .",,,
" Although IL-10 alone did not induce HIV-1 replication , in the presence of TNF-alpha , IL-10 markedly enhanced virion production from a chronically infected promonocytic cell line ( U1 ) and in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages .",,,
 Neutralizing mAbs to IL-10 and TNF-alpha indicated that both cytokines were essential for the induction and were required to generate a synergistic increase in virus expression .,,,
" The effects of the two cytokines were distinguishable functionally since pretreatment with TNF-alpha attenuated the cytokine cooperativity , while pretreatment with IL-10 potentiated their cooperativity , suggesting that IL-10 and TNF-alpha play different roles in the activation of virus .",,,
" Northern blot analysis as well as Ab blocking and cytokine secretion studies indicated that the induction of either endogenous TNF-alpha or IL-10 was not involved in the cooperativity , nor was an up-regulation of TNF-alpha receptors .",induction;,16;,Positive_regulation;
" In combination with TNF-alpha , IL-10 stimulated activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B binding activities and cooperated to increase HIV-1 steady-state mRNA levels and enhance long terminal repeat-directed transcription through activation of the NF-kappa B binding sites , suggesting the IL-10 effect occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level .",,,
" These results indicate that IL-10 , in addition to down-regulating the cellular immune response to HIV-1 , may also play a role in TNF-alpha - mediated activation of HIV-1 replication in the monocyte/macrophage lineage .",,,

" In THP-1 cells , Fc gamma R cross-linking induced NF-kappa B , which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription .",,,
 Anti - TNF-alpha antibody but not anti - IL-1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription and the induction of NF-kappa B by Fc gamma R cross-linking .,,,
 These results indicate that Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF-alpha - dependent induction of HIV-1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes .,,,

 Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in human T-cell lines by anetholdithiolthione .,,,
 Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B is a redox sensitive cytosolic transcription factor .,,,
 Redox regulation of NF-kappa B has been implicated in the activation of the human immuno-deficiency virus ( HIV ) .,,,
" Therefore , inhibition of NF-kappa B activation may be an effective strategy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome therapy .",,,
" Anetholdithiolthione ( ADT , 5-[p-methoxyphenyl]-3H-1,2-dithiol-3-thione ) is an antioxidant which has been used to protect against acetaminophen- and CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity , lipid peroxidation , radiation injury , and also has been used clinically as an anti-choleretic agent .",,,
" The present study examined the effect of ADT pretreatment on NF-kappa B activation in response to a variety of stimuli such as H2O2 , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) .",,,
 PMA and TNF alpha induced activation of ( NF ) -kappa B in human Jurkat T-cells was partially inhibited by ADT ( 0.1 mM ) pretreatment .,,,
 ADT ( 0.1 mM ) also inhibited H2O2 induced activation of the transcription factor in the peroxide sensitive human Wurzburg T-cells .,,,
" Furthermore , ADT treated Wurzburg cells had significantly higher glutathione levels as compared with untreated cells .",,,
 H2O2 induced lipid peroxidation in Wurzburg cells was remarkably inhibited by ADT pretreatment .,,,

 Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle .,,,
 A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity .,,,
" Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( HD1 ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library .",,,
" As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription .",,,

 GATA transcription factors associate with a novel class of nuclear bodies in erythroblasts and megakaryocytes .,,,
 The nuclear distribution of GATA transcription factors in murine haemopoietic cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence .,,,

 Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intensely labelled structures likely to represent the GATA-1 foci seen by immunofluorescence .,,,

 Permanent occupancy of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer by NF-kappa B is needed for persistent viral replication in monocytes .,,,
 This work aimed to ascertain the role of kappaB-responsive elements of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer not only in early initiation but also in long-term maintenance of proviral transcription in cells of the monocytic lineage .,,,
" For this purpose , we used three main approaches .",,,
" The first was to abruptly terminate tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB binding to the enhancer sequences in U1 monocytic cells , using a short pulse of exogenous tumor necrosis factor .",,,
 This resulted in concomitant decrease in nuclear NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and endogenous long terminal repeat transcriptional activity .,,,
" The second was to suppress the permanent NF-kappaB translocation induced by HIV-1 replication itself in chronically infected U937 cells , using a specific proteasome inhibitor ( Z-LLL-H ) .",,,
" As early as 2 h after addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium , there was an inhibition of both constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and HIV-1 genome expression .",,,
 The third approach was to monitor the replication competence in U937 cells of an infectious HIV-1 provirus carrying point mutations in the kappaB-responsive elements of both long terminal repeats .,,,
" Compared with its wild-type counterpart , this mutated provirus showed a profoundly decreased , Z-LLL-H-insensitive transcriptional and replicative activity in U937 monocytes .",,,
" Together , our results indicate that occupancy of the viral enhancer by NF-kappaB ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimers is required for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in monocytes , even in cells chronically infected and permanently producing functional HIV Tat protein .",occupancy;producing;,7;39;,Binding;Gene_expression;

 Efficient transcription and replication of simian immunodeficiency virus in the absence of NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding elements .,,,
" Ten mutants of the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) SIVmac239 bearing deletions ( delta ) or substitutions ( subst ) in the NF-kappaB and/or Sp1 binding elements were created , and the replicative capacities of the mutants were analyzed .",,,
" All mutants , including one extensively mutagenized strain entirely missing the NF-kappaB and four Spl binding elements , replicated with wild-type kinetics and to a wild-type level in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures in 50 to 100 % of the experiments .",,,
" One group of mutants replicated very similarly to SIVmac239 in kinetics and yield in CEMxl74 cells ( 2xNFKappaB > or = SlVmac239 approximately deltaNFkappaB approximately deltaSpl234 approximately substNFkappaB approximately substSpl2 approximately substSp23 ) , while a second group replicated with delayed or slightly delayed kinetics in CEMxl74 cells ( SIVmac239 > substSp34 > deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl234 approximately deltaNFkappaBdeltaSp1 > substSpl234 ) .",,,
 Reversions or additional mutations were not detected in the U3 and R regions of proviral DNA from CEMxl74 cells infected with the SIVmac239 mutants .,,,
 Similar results were obtained when mutants of SIVmacMER ( a macrophage-competent derivative of SIVmac239 ) were tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cell and CEMx174 cultures .,,,
" However , the growth of most mutated viruses was suppressed in primary rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages ( SIVmacMER approximately 2xNFkappaB approximately substNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl234 approximately deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl > deltaSpl234 approximately substSpl2 > substSp23 approximately substSp34 approximately substSpl234 > or = SIVmac239 ) .",,,
" Thus , changes in the Sp1 binding sites had the most dramatic effects on SIVmac replication in primary macrophage cultures .",,,
" Analysis of long terminal repeat-driven secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in transient assays showed that , unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , the SIV long terminal repeat possesses an enhancer region just upstream of the NF-kappaB element which maintains significant levels of basal transcription in the absence of NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites .",,,
 This region is responsive to transactivation by Tat .,,,
" In addition , the SIV TATA box was shown to be stronger than that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .",,,
" Therefore , the surprisingly high replicative capacity of NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding site mutants of SIVmac is due to unique features or the enhancer/promoter region .",,,

 In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR was performed to correlate in vivo protein binding with functional activity .,,,
 A protein footprint was visible over this region of the c-myb 5' flanking sequence in activated T cells but not in unactivated T cells .,,,
" An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with nuclear extract from activated T cells and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new protein-DNA complex , referred to as CMAT for c-myb in activated T cells ; this complex was not present in unactivated T cells .",,,
" Because the binding site showed some sequence similarity with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) binding site , we compared the kinetics of induction of the two binding complexes and the molecular masses of the two proteins .",,,

 CNI-1493 inhibits monocyte/macrophage tumor necrosis factor by suppression of translation efficiency .,,,
" Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) mediates a wide variety of disease states including septic shock , acute and chronic inflammation , and cachexia .",,,
 We have now elucidated the mechanism by which CNI-1493 inhibits macrophage TNF synthesis and show here that it acts through suppression of TNF translation efficiency .,,,
" CNI-1493 blocked neither the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced increases in the expression of TNF mRNA nor the translocation of nuclear factor NF-kappa B to the nucleus in macrophages activated by 15 min of LPS stimulation , indicating that CNI-1493 does not interfere with early NF-kappa B-mediated transcriptional regulation of TNF .",,,
" However , synthesis of the 26-kDa membrane form of TNF was effectively blocked by CNI-1493 .",,,
 Further evidence for the translational suppression of TNF is given by experiments using chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) constructs containing elements of the TNF gene that are involved in TNF translational regulation .,,,
 Both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the TNF gene were required to elicit maximal translational suppression by CNI-1493 .,,,
 Identification of the molecular target through which CNI- 1493 inhibits TNF translation should provide insight into the regulation of macrophage activation and mechanisms of inflammation .,,,
 STAT-related transcription factors are constitutively activated in peripheral blood cells from acute leukemia patients .,,,
 A signal transduction pathway activated by many cytokines has recently been elaborated .,,,
 The JAK kinases and the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors have been found to be essential components .,,,
" In this report , we describe the presence of constitutively activated STAT factors in peripheral blood cells from patients with acute leukemia .",,,
 We used oligonucleotide probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters and the ISRE probe to detect STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells in bandshift assays .,,,
" Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters , but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe , when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) were investigated .",,,
 We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation .,,,
 Specific antibodies directed against the individual STAT proteins were used in supershift experiments .,,,
" STAT5 - and STAT1 - related factors were detected in ALL and STAT1 - , STAT3 - , and STAT5 - related proteins were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML .",,,
" Since the cells were not treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted , we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo .",,,
 It is likely that the constitutive activation of STAT proteins is a part of the events of leukemogenesis .,,,
" Reversible differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells by ML-9 , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase .",,,
 Human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells are induced to differentiate into monocytes and macrophages by various agents .,,,
" We have shown that 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride ( ML-9 ) , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase , induces differentiation of monocytoid leukemia cell lines U937 and THP-1 but not of myeloblastic leukemic ML-1 cell or erythroleukemia K562 cells .",,,
" In the present study , we further analyzed the effect of ML-9 in comparison with that of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) a typical inducer of monocytic differentiation .",,,
" ML-9 induced nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) -reducing activity of U937 cell more rapidly than VD3 : This differentiation marker was induced significantly after incubation with ML-9 and VD3 for 4 hours and 1 day , respectively .",,,
" ML-9 also induced alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase ( ANAE ) activity , another monocytic differentiation marker , more rapidly than VD3 .",,,
" The maximum levels of these markers induced by ML-9 were comparable to those induced by VD3 , but after removal of ML-9 from the medium by washing the cells , the expressions of theses markers decreased within 4 hours and reached basal levels in 1 day , indicating that ML-9 's induction of expression of differentiation-associated phenotypes was reversible .",,,
 The growth inhibition of U937 cells by ML-9 was also reversible .,,,
" Similar effects were observed in another line of human monoblastic cells , THP-1 .",,,
" ML-9 had little or no effect on the morphology of U937 cells but increased the expression of monocyte-macrophage lineage-associated surface antigen , CD14 , to some extent .",increased;expression;,14;16;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c-myc and upregulation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun , but ML-9 did not affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably .",expression;upregulation;expression;affect;expression;,14;18;21;31;33;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Regulation;Gene_expression;
 ML-9-induced differentiation was also reversible when the cells were cultured with cultured with ML-9 plus an anti-cancer drug such as 1-beta-D-arabino-furanosylcytosine or daunomycin .,,,
" it became irreversible , however , upon simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) , which did not induce differentiation of U937 cells but caused growth arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle .",,,
 These results suggest that ML-9 should be useful for studying the mechanisms of monocytic differentiation .,,,
 Interferon-gamma modulates the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of AP-1 and NF-kappa B at the mRNA and protein level in human monocytes .,,,
 Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) modulates the expression of several cytokines by human monocytes at the transcriptional level .,,,
" In view of these findings , we analyzed the effects of IFN-gamma on the expression of different transcription factors in activated human monocytes .",,,
 Priming of human monocytes with IFN-gamma resulted in the down regulation of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) compared to the effects of LPS alone .,,,
" Not only was this effect observed at the mRNA level , but activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) DNA binding capacity was affected as well , A strong reduction was observed in the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of AP-1 in the presence of IFN-gamma .",,,
" LPS-stimulated monocytes showed an increased expression of p105 mRNA , the precursor of the p50 subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , while no effect was noticed on the expression of p65 mRNA .",increased;expression;effect;expression;,5;6;31;36;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;Regulation;Transcription;

" The effects of IFN-gamma on the transcription factors were specific , since no change was observed in the expression of NF-IL-6 or I kappa B alpha , the inhibitor of NF-kappa B .",change;expression;,14;19;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 We conclude that the effects of IFN-gamma on the expression of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappa B may be important for the modulatory effects of IFN-gamma on the cytokine expression in activated human monocytes .,,,

 Involvement of intracellular Ca2+ in oxidant-induced NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 In human Jurkat T cells and its subclone Wurzburg cells oxidant challenge elevated [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores .,,,
" In Jurkat cells this effect was rapid and transient , but in Wurzburg cells the response was slow and sustained .",,,
 H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA .,,,
" In Jurkat cells that are not sensitive to H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation , H2O2 potentiated NF-kappaB activation in the presence of sustained high [Ca2+]i following thapsigargin treatment .",,,
" NF-kappaB regulatory effect of alpha-lipoate and N-acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of [Ca2+]i following oxidant challenge .",,,
 Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i is a significant factor in oxidant-induced NF-kappaB activation .,,,

 Heat shock induces HIV-1 replication in chronically infected promyelocyte cell line OM10.1 .,,,
 A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection .,,,
" OM10.1 , a promyelocyte cell line latently infected with HIV-1 , has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression .",,,
 We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any cytokines .,,,
 The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using anti - TNF-alpha antibody and various inhibitors .,,,
" Although the TNF-alpha level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti - TNF-alpha antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production .",,,

 Triplex formation by GM3 blocked recombinant and nuclear NF-kappaB proteins binding to the GM-CSF element .,,,
 GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax transactivator-induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM-CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells .,,,

 Cooperation between core binding factor and adjacent promoter elements contributes to the tissue-specific expression of interleukin-3 .,contributes;expression;,10;14;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Tissue-specific expression of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is mediated via cis-acting elements located within 315 base pairs of the transcription start .,expression;mediated;,2;9;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 This is achieved in part through the positive activities of the AP-1 and Elf-1 sites in the IL-3 promoter .,,,
" The contribution to T cell-specific expression by other promoter sites was assessed in a transient expression assay with IL-3 promoter constructs linked to a luciferase gene , focusing initially on the core binding factor ( CBF ) site , which is footprinted in vivo upon T cell activation .",,,
 Activity of the CBF site is shown to be critically dependent on the adjacent activator site Act-1 .,,,
 Together the Act-1 and CBF sites form a functional unit ( AC unit ) with dual activity .,,,
 The AC unit is demonstrated to enhance basal activity of promoters both in fibroblasts and T cells .,,,
" This activity is further inducible in activated T cells , but not in fibroblasts .",,,
" In addition to the already identified NIP repressor site , evidence is presented for a second repressor region that restricts promoter activity in fibroblasts .",,,
" Finally , a novel positive regulatory element has been mapped in the IL-3 promoter between nucleotide -180 and -210 that leads to increased expression in T cells .",,,

" We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells ; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site , and the PU.1 autoregulatory site .",,,
" Finally , we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1 / Bob1 / OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells , and that OBF-1 / Bob1 / OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells .",expressed;transactivate;,17;35;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;

" The -1053/+34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin , and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested .",,,
 The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity .,,,

 Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene has revealed several positive and negative regulatory elements involved in the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .,expression;expression;,2;35;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 An AP-1 site at -146 to -140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene .,expression;,15;,Gene_expression;
 A proximal region between -46 and -80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .,expression;,19;,Gene_expression;
" Within this region , an NF-kappaB site at -59 to -50 and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL-9 promoter activity .",,,
" DNA-protein binding studies indicated that NF-kappaB , c-Jun , and potentially novel proteins ( around 35 kDa ) can bind to this important sequence .",bind;,20;,Binding;
 Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding .,abolished;,10;,Negative_regulation;

 Mapping of the transcriptional repression domain of the lymphoid-specific transcription factor oct-2A .,,,
 The lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2a is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif .,,,
 Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini .,,,
 The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct B cell-specific coactivators .,potentiated;interactions;,9;11;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" Recently , we have identified a repression domain located within the N terminus of Oct-2a ( amino acids 2-99 ) .",,,
" When this domain was transferred to a potent activator , transcription was strongly inhibited .",,,
 In this study we present a deletion analysis of the N-terminal region of Oct-2a to determine the minimal repression domain .,,,
" We identified a stretch of 23 amino acids , rich in serine and threonine residues , which was responsible for most of the repression activity .",,,
 We show that repression is strongly dependent on the type of enhancer present in the reporter plasmid as well as on the cell line tested .,,,
 The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes .,,,
 The role of BSAP ( Pax-5 ) in B-cell development .,,,
 The hierarchy of transcriptional control in B-cell development has recently been analyzed by targeted gene inactivation in the mouse .,,,
" In this manner , the paired box containing gene Pax-5 , encoding the B cell specific transcription factor BSAP , has been shown to play a key role in early B lymphopoiesis .",,,
" Other experimental strategies have implicated BSAP in the control of cell proliferation , isotype switching and transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene at late stages of B-cell differentiation .",,,
 Modulation of the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor beta-chain controls responsiveness to IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood T cells .,Modulation;expression;,1;4;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation .,,,
" Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag .",,,
" In this work , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma , as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor , STAT1(alpha) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription .",activation;,34;,Positive_regulation;
" This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta- chain ( accessory factor ) of the IFN-gamma receptor , while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression .",expression;expression;,9;32;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment .,,,
 T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma .,,,
" When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness ; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain .",,,
" Therefore , as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2 - dependent proliferation , followed by secondary TCR stimulation , their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies , and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response .",,,
 Induction of CIITA and modification of in vivo HLA-DR promoter occupancy in normal thymic epithelial cells treated with IFN-gamma : similarities and distinctions with respect to HLA-DR-constitutive B cells .,Induction;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" In this study , the IFN-gamma induction of MHC class II gene expression in primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) was analyzed .",,,
" This cellular system offers the advantage that MHC class II induction is studied in a "" physiologic "" cell lineage that , as a result of this expression within the thymus , is thought to participate to the selection and maturation of the T cells .",,,
" It was found that the MHC class II gene expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the CIITA trans-activator , a crucial MHC class II gene regulatory factor .",transcription;,17;,Transcription;
" Furthermore , the anatomy of interaction between the MHC class II DRA promoter and corresponding binding factors was analyzed by in vivo DNAse I footprint .",,,
 It was found that treatment with IFN-gamma induces changes in the occupancy of the DRA gene regulatory sequences by nuclear factors .,,,
" The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the MHC class II-constitutive B cells , represented by both the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji and normal tonsil- derived B cells .",,,
" However , some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC , either IFN-gamma - induced or not , and the constitutive B cells .",,,
" These results suggest that both common mechanisms , such as the one mediated by the CIITA trans-activator , and distinct tissue-specific constraints contribute to the transcriptional control of constitutive and IFN-gamma - induced MHC class II gene expression .",,,
 Recombinant NFAT1 ( NFATp ) is regulated by calcineurin in T cells and mediates transcription of several cytokine genes .,,,
 Transcription factors of the NFAT family play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .,,,
 We have identified two new isoforms of the transcription factor NFAT1 ( previously termed NFATp ) that are the predominant isoforms expressed in murine and human T cells .,,,
" When expressed in Jurkat T cells , recombinant NFAT1 is regulated , as expected , by the calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin , and its function is inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .",,,
 Transactivation by recombinant NFAT1 in Jurkat T cells requires dual stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; this activity is potentiated by coexpression of constitutively active calcineurin and is inhibited by CsA .,,,
 Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that recombinant NFAT1 localizes in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected T cells and translocates into the nucleus in a CsA-sensitive manner following ionomycin stimulation .,,,
" When expressed in COS cells , however , NFAT1 is capable of transactivation , but it is not regulated correctly : its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are not affected by stimulation of the COS cells with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .",expressed;,2;,Gene_expression;
" Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin-2 , interleukin-4 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells , suggesting that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response .",mediate;transcription;contributes;transcription;,4;5;29;33;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 An alternatively spliced isoform of the Spi-B transcription factor .,,,
 Spi-B is an Ets transcription factor related to the oncoprotein Spi-1 / PU.1 and highly expressed in B lymphoid cells .,expressed;,16;,Gene_expression;
 The Ets proteins share a conserved Ets domain that mediates specific DNA binding .,,,
 Spi-B binds DNA sequences containing a core 5'-GGAA-3' and activates transcription through this motif .,binds;,2;,Binding;
" Up to date , the biological function of Spi-B remains unknown .",,,
" Here , we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of Spi-B , named deltaSpi-B , which has lost the Ets domain .",,,
" In B lymphoid cells , deltaspi-B and spi-B mRNAs were present simultaneously in a ratio of around 10 % .",present;,11;,Transcription;
 DeltaSpi-B product was not able to bind DNA and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts .,bind;recovered;,7;11;,Binding;Localization;
 We raise the hypothesis that delta Spi-B might affect Spi-B function by recruiting factors involved in Spi-B activity .,affect;,9;,Regulation;
 Activation protein 1 - dependent transcriptional activation of interleukin 2 gene by Ca2+/calmodulin kinase type IV/Gr .,dependent;,5;,Positive_regulation;
" The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement .",expressed;activated;,12;18;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21ras oncoprotein .,,,
 CaMKIV/ Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin .,,,
" AP-1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells .",required;expression;,22;27;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells .,,,
 These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca(2+)-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .,,,
 Mechanisms of transactivation by nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 .,,,
" Nuclear factor of activated T cells-family proteins ( NFAT1 / NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFAT4 / NFATx / NFATc3 ) play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .",,,
 We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 .,,,
" NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains whose sequences are not conserved in the other NFAT-family proteins , and a conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein .",expressed;,35;,Gene_expression;
 The activity of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain is modulated by an adjacent regulatory region that contains several conserved sequence motifs represented only in the NFAT family .,,,
" Our results emphasize the multiple levels at which NFAT-dependent transactivation is regulated , and predict significant differences in the architecture of cooperative transcription complexes containing different NFAT-family proteins .",,,
" BCL-6 , a POZ/zinc-finger protein , is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor .",,,
 Approximately 40 % of diffuse large cell lymphoma are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of the BCL6 gene by juxtaposing heterologous promoters to the BCL-6 coding domain .,deregulate;expression;,15;17;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
" The BCL6 gene encodes a 95-kDa protein containing six C-terminal zinc-finger motifs and an N-terminal POZ domain , suggesting that it may function as a transcription factor .",,,
" By using a DNA sequence selected for its ability to bind recombinant BCL-6 in vitro , we show here that BCL-6 is present in DNA-binding complexes in nuclear extracts from various B-cell lines .",,,
" In transient transfectin experiments , BCL6 can repress transcription from promoters linked to its DNA target sequence and this activity is dependent upon specific DNA-binding and the presence of an intact N-terminal half of the protein .",,,
" We demonstrate that this part of the BCL6 molecule contains an autonomous transrepressor domain and that two noncontiguous regions , including the POZ motif , mediate maximum transrepressive activity .",,,
 These results indicate that the BCL-6 protein can function as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor and have implications for the role of BCL6 in normal lymphoid development and lymphomagenesis .,,,
 Constitutive expression of specific interferon isotypes in peripheral blood leukocytes from normal individuals and in promonocytic U937 cells .,,,
 Constitutive expression of IFN-alpha5 and IFN-beta was detected in different lymphoid cells including peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal individuals following amplification of IFN mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the amplified product .,expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 The activated form of the interferon-induced transcription factor complex ISGF3 was also detected in nuclear extracts from uninduced cells .,,,
" Culture supernatants from uninduced U937 cells were also found to activate an ISRE cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene , indicating the presence of endogenous IFN activity equivalent to approximately 0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL .",,,
 This endogenous IFN was also shown to play a role in maintaining the basal level of expression of the major histocompatibility class I genes in lymphoid cells .,,,
 These results suggest that IFN-alpha5 and IFN-beta are produced at low levels in normal tissues and play an important role in the regulation of cell function and in the maintenance of homeostasis .,produced;,9;,Gene_expression;
 Characterization of a new isoform of the NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) gene family member NFATc [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1996 Dec 27;271(52):33705 ],,,
 The cyclosporin A ( CsA ) /FK506-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) plays a key role in the inducible expression of cytokine genes in T cells .,,,
" Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells , the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells .",,,
" To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins , we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line .",,,
" The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform , NFATc.beta , of the NFAT gene family member NFATc ( designated here NFATc.alpha ) .",,,
 The amino acid sequence of NFATc.beta differs from that of NFATc.alpha in the first NH2-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus .,,,
" Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs , while an NFATc.beta - specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen .",,,
 Transient expression of NFATc.beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner .,expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
" However , NFATc.beta neither bound to the kappa3 element ( an NFAT-binding site ) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays .",bound;activated;,5;22;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
 These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes .,,,
" Cytokine-modulating activity of tepoxalin , a new potential antirheumatic .",,,
 Tepoxalin is a new dual cyclooxygenase/5-lipoxygenase anti-inflammatory compound currently under clinical investigation .,,,
 It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit IL-2 induced signal transduction .,,,
 The current study was conducted to evaluate the cytokine modulating activity of tepoxalin and the role of iron in these effects .,,,
" In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated with OKT3/PMA , tepoxalin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation with an IC50 of 6 microM .",,,
" Additionally , it inhibited the production of LTB4 ( IC50 = 0.5 microM ) and the cytokines IL-2 , IL-6 and TNF alpha ( IC50 = 10-12 microM ) .",inhibited;production;,4;6;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Cytotoxicity was not demonstrated at these concentrations .,,,
" Add-back experiments with either cytokines ( IL-2 or IL-6 ) , LTB4 or conditioned media failed to restore the proliferative response in the presence of tepoxalin .",,,
" However , the concurrent addition of iron ( in the form of ferrous or ferric chloride and other iron salts ) reversed the inhibition of proliferation caused by tepoxalin .",,,
" Tepoxalin also inhibits the activation of NF kappa B , a transcription factor which acts on several cytokine genes .",,,
 Tepoxalin 's effect on NF kappa B is also reversed by the addition of iron salts .,,,
 These data suggest that the action of tepoxalin to inhibit proliferation in PBMC may be at least in part due to its ability to reduce the amount of available iron resulting in decreased activation of NF kappa B and subsequent inhibition of cytokine production .,,,
 oriP is essential for EBNA gene promoter activity in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines .,,,
" During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of B lymphocytes in vitro , six viral nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) are expressed from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , whose activities are mutually exclusive .",,,
" Upon infection , Wp is initially active , followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency .",active;switch;,7;12;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" In this study , the region upstream of Cp was analyzed for the presence of cis elements involved in regulating the activities of the EBNA gene promoters in established in vitro immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .",,,
" It was determined that oriP , the origin for episomal maintenance during latency , is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs , as well as in some Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines .",,,
 Deletion of the EBNA2 - dependent enhancer located upstream of Cp resulted in a ca. two- to fivefold reduction in Cp activity in the LCLs assayed .,reduction;,19;,Negative_regulation;
" More extensive deletion of sequences upstream of Cp , including the EBNA2 - dependent enhancer , resulted in nearly complete loss of Cp activity .",loss;,21;,Negative_regulation;
" This loss of activity was shown to correlate with deletion of two CCAAT boxes , a proximal CCAAT box located at bp -61 to -65 and a distal CCAAT box located at bp -253 to -257 , upstream of Cp .",,,
" Site-directed mutagenesis of these cis elements demonstrated that Cp activity is highly dependent on the presence of a properly positioned CCAAT box , with the dependence on the distal CCAAT box apparent only when the proximal CCAAT box was deleted or mutated .",dependent;dependence;,13;26;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Deletion of the glucocorticoid response elements located at ca. bp -850 upstream of Cp did not result in a significant loss in activity .,loss;,21;,Negative_regulation;

 Various modes of basic helix-loop-helix protein-mediated regulation of murine leukemia virus transcription in lymphoid cell lines .,,,
" The transcriptionally regulatory regions of the lymphomagenic Akv and SL3-3 murine leukemia retroviruses ( MLVs ) contain two types of E-box consensus motifs , CAGATG .",,,
" One type , EA/S , is located in the upstream promoter region , and the other , E(gre) , is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties .",,,
 We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation .,,,
" In lymphoid cell lines only , the E(gre)- binding protein complexes included ALF1 or HEB and E2A basic helix-loop-helix proteins .",binding;,9;,Binding;
 Ectopic ALF1 and E2A proteins required intact E(gre) motifs for mediating transcriptional activation .,,,
" ALF1 transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two E(gre) motifs equally , whereas E2A protein required the promoter-proximal E(gre) motif .",,,
" In T- and B-cell lines , the E(gre) motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity , while the EA/S motif had some effect .",,,
" In contrast , neither E(gre) nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA - binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins .",lacking;binding;,19;22;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
 The Id1 protein was found to repress ALF1 activity in vitro and in vivo .,,,
" Moreover , ectopic Id1 repressed E(gre)-directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines .",,,
" In conclusion , E(gre) motifs and interacting basic helix-loop-helix proteins are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytic cell lines .",interacting;,7;,Binding;
 Gene transcription through activation of G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors .,,,
" Receptors for leukocyte chemoattractants , including chemokines , are traditionally considered to be responsible for the activation of special leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis , degranulation , and the release of superoxide anions .",,,
" Recently , these G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors have been found to transduce signals leading to gene transcription and translation in leukocytes .",,,
" Transcription factors , such as NF kappa B and AP-1 , are activated upon stimulation of the cells with several chemoattractants at physiologically relevant concentrations .",,,
 Activation of transcription factors through these receptors involves G-protein coupling and the activation of protein kinases .,,,
" The underlying signaling pathways appear to be different from those utilized by TNF-alpha , a better characterized cytokine that induces the transcription of immediate-early genes .",,,
" Chemoattractants stimulate the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , which in turn may activate their respective receptors and initiate an autocrine regulatory mechanism for persistent cytokine and chemokine gene expression .",,,
 Regulation of gene expression at early stages of B-cell and T-cell differentiation .,,,
 The expression of distinct sets of genes at different stages of B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription .,,,
 A number of recent studies have described interactions between transcription factors in lymphocytes that provide new insights into mechanisms regulating gene expression .,,,
 These mechanisms include the assembly of higher order nucleoprotein complexes and other protein-protein interactions that enhance the functional specificity of transcriptional regulators in lymphocytes .,,,
 Involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial adhesion molecule induction .,,,
 Induction of endothelial adhesion molecules by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) can occur independently of protein kinase C and activation of a protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) has recently been implicated in the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 ) by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on endothelial cells .,upregulation;,38;,Positive_regulation;

" Inhibition studies indicate that specific tyrosine phosphorylation following PTK activation is involved in the mobilization of the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappa B , and VCAM-1 mRNA expression .",expression;,29;,Transcription;
 This may have implications for pathophysiological conditions that involve the upregulation of these molecules ( e.g. inflammation and atherosclerosis ) .,,,
 Transcription specific differences visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization pattern on interphase nuclei of different cell types .,,,
" Application of a "" formamide free "" and thus "" material preserving "" in situ hybridization technique using the cDNA of the myf3 gene revealed the following results : Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells , characterized by a high expression of myf3 show intensive hybridization signals in their interphase .",expression;intensive;,38;42;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
 RNase treatment prior to hybridization considerably reduces the size of this signals .,,,
" In comparison , isolated nuclei of human lymphocytes in which no need for the expression of this gene exists , show barely hybridization signals .",expression;,15;,Gene_expression;
" Correspondingly , RNase treatment had no effect on hybridization pattern at all .",,,
 In conclusion an increased transcription efficiency of a cell type specific gene is accompanied by a higher hybridization accessibility in the corresponding cell nuclei .,,,
 Precise alignment of sites required for mu enhancer activation in B cells .,,,
 The lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene intronic enhancer is regulated by multiple nuclear factors .,,,
" The previously defined minimal enhancer containing the muA , muE3 , and muB sites is transactivated by a combination of the ETS-domain proteins PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells .",combination;,19;,Binding;
" The core GGAAs of the muA and muB sites are separated by 30 nucleotides , suggesting that ETS proteins bind to these sites from these same side of the DNA helix .",,,
 We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these elements by using mutated enhancers with altered spacings .,,,
" A 4- or 10-bp insertion between muE3 and muB inactivated the mu enhancer in S194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1 , PU.1 , or the muE3-binding protein TFE3 , alone or in pairwise combinations .",affect;binding;,21;24;,Regulation;Binding;
 Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets-1 bends mu enhancer DNA toward the major groove .,binding;,9;,Binding;
 We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the muA and muB elements is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by PU.1 .,,,
 Alpha 4 beta 1 ( CD49d/CD29 ) integrin costimulation of human T cells enhances transcription factor and cytokine induction in the absence of altered sensitivity to anti-CD3 stimulation .,,,

" Similar to expression of IL-2 , we demonstrated that recombinant vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 , when co-immobilized with anti-CD3 mAb , significantly enhanced the induction of transcription factors NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappa B as determined by electromobility shift assays. alpha 4 beta 1 ligation alone had no effect on transcription factor binding .",expression;ligation;,3;45;,Gene_expression;Binding;
" The requirements for induction of transcription factors reflected the requirements for the secretion of multiple cytokines , including IL-2 , TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma , and granulocyte macrophage-CSF .",secretion;,13;,Localization;
" In contrast to freshly isolated T cells , in vitro-cultured T cells did not require costimulation for cytokine secretion in response to anti-CD3 alone .",,,
 Comparison of the dose response to anti-CD3 stimulation demonstrated that half-maximal induction of IL-2 was achieved using the same dose of anti-CD3 for both freshly isolated and cultured T cells .,induction;,12;,Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , the dose of OKT3 required to achieve half-maximal activation was the same using PMA or different concentrations of alpha 4 beta 1 ligands .",,,
" Therefore , costimulation by alpha 4 beta 1 ligands was not due to stabilization of the interaction of the cells with its substrate .",,,
" We conclude , rather , that alpha 4 beta 1 in freshly isolated T cells delivers a distinct signal that synergizes early with signals initiated by TCR/CD3 ligation to induce DNA binding of multiple transcription factors required for cytokine gene induction .",,,

 C/EBP activators are required for HIV-1 replication and proviral induction in monocytic cell lines .,,,
 Previous work has shown that C/EBP sites and C/EBP transcriptional activators are necessary for HIV-1 LTR activity in monocytes/macrophages .,,,
 We have investigated the role that C/EBP proteins play in induction and replication of HIV-1 .,,,
" Ectopic expression of the dominant negative C/EBP protein LIP inhibited HIV-1 mRNA and virus production in activated U1 cells , demonstrating that C/EBP proteins are required for provirus induction .",,,
" U1 lines overexpressing C/EBP activator NF-IL-6 produced more viral mRNA and virus particles following cellular activation than control lines , demonstrating that C/EBP proteins are limiting for virus transcription .",overexpressing;,3;,Positive_regulation;
" HIV-1 harboring mutations within two C/EBP sites were crippled in their ability to replicate in U937 promonocytic cells , indicating that these sites are required for replication .",,,

 Inhibition of transcription factor Stat1 activity in mononuclear cell cultures and T cells by the cyclic AMP signaling pathway .,Inhibition;,1;,Negative_regulation;
 Activation of T cells results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes .,,,
 The regulation of transcription factors belonging to the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family was analyzed in PHA - activated mononuclear cells and in purified T cells activated by cross-linking cell surface CD3 .,,,
" Cell activation resulted in a delayed induction of STAT DNA-binding activity , which was sustained for several days , was composed predominantly of Stat1 and Stat3 , and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D .",,,
" Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected , respectively 4 and 24 h after activation .",,,

" Although case-oriented evidence for an association of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) with gastric carcinoma has been accumulating recently , the interaction(s) between EBV and gastric epithelial cells is/are largely unknown .",,,
" In this study , we examined seven EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues for viral gene expression at the mRNA level , from which studies on the EBV oncogenicity in human epithelial cells will benefit .",,,
" Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV-positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) 1 mRNA , but not EBNA2 mRNA .",expressed;,12;,Transcription;
" The EBNA transcription was initiated from one of three EBNA promoters , Qp : by contrast , both Cp and Wp were silent , thus resulting in the lack of EBNA2 mRNA .",resulting;lack;,26;29;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;

 Transcripts from the BamHI-A region of the viral genome were detectable in all cases .,,,
" BZLF1 mRNA and the product , an immediate-early gene for EBV replication , was not expressed in any of them , thereby suggesting that the tumour cells carried EBV genomes in a tightly latent form .",expressed;,16;,Transcription;
" These findings further extended our previous data regarding EBV latency in gastric carcinoma cells at the protein level , and have affirmed that the programme of viral gene expression in the tumour more closely resembles ' latency I ' represented by Burkitt 's lymphoma than ' latency II ' represented by the majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas .",,,
 The role of early growth response gene 1 ( egr-1 ) in regulation of the immune response .,,,
 The induction of immediate early genes in cells of the immune system is critical to determining the ultimate outcome of exposure to antigen .,,,
" The importance of many of these genes relates to the role their transcription factor products play in dictating patterns of expression of downstream , function-related genes .",,,
" Evidence from several systems indicates that the immediate early gene , egr-1 may be of particular importance in the immune system .",,,
" Recently , the egr-1 promoter has been shown to be highly responsive to the diverse biochemical signals generated by antigen and cytokines in cells of the immune system .",,,
" Furthermore , an important role for egr-1 in determining the differentiation pathway of myeloid cell precursors has been recently elaborated .",,,
" Finally , potential targets of regulation by the zinc-finger transcription factor encoded by egr-1 include the interleukin-2 , CD44 , ICAM-1 , and tumor necrosis factor genes .",regulation;,6;,Regulation;
 The role of egr-1 in regulation of the immune response will be discussed in the context of these recent studies .,,,
 Apoptosis mediated by HIV protease is preceded by cleavage of Bcl-2 .,cleavage;,9;,Protein_catabolism;

 Activation of Stat 5b in erythroid progenitors correlates with the ability of ErbB to induce sustained cell proliferation .,Activation;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB , whereas other receptors ( c-Kit / Epo-R ) regulate erythroid differentiation .",,,
" To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of c-ErbB , we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family .",,,
" Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA - binding , and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5b in erythroblasts .",induced;phosphorylation;binding;,5;8;12;,Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;Binding;

 Evidence for lowered induction of nuclear factor kappa B in activated human T lymphocytes during aging .,,,
" Transcription factor NF kappa B ( nuclear factor kappa B ) is induced in T lymphocytes from young individuals following activation with a variety of stimuli including anti-CD3 , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .",,,
" In contrast , activated T lymphocytes from older individuals show a significant reduction in the induction of NF kappa B in response to the same stimuli .",,,
" The age-related decline in induction of NF kappa B could not be attributed to alteration in the composition of subunits , p50 and p65 were found to be the predominant subunits of induced NF kappa B in T cells from young as well as elderly donors .",induced;,33;,Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , similar levels of NF kappa B were found in the cytosols of unactivated T cells from both young and elderly donors suggesting that precursor levels of NF kappa B remain unaltered during aging .",,,
" These results suggest that an age-associated decline in the induction of NF kappa B in activated T cells from elderly individuals may be attributable to altered regulation of the inhibitor , I kappa B , and may play an important role in immune dysregulation accompanying aging .",,,
 Interaction of HTLV-I Tax with the human proteasome : implications for NF-kappa B induction .,Interaction;,1;,Binding;
 The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has been etiologically associated with the development of the adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) as well as degenerative neurologic syndrome termed tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) .,,,
 HTLV-I encodes a potent transactivator protein termed Tax that appears to play an important role in the process of T-cell immortalization .,,,
" Even though the mechanisms by which Tax induces transformation are still unknown , it seems likely that the ability of Tax to alter the expression of many cellular genes plays an important part in this process .",,,
 Tax does not bind directly to DNA but rather deregulates the activity of cellular transcription factors .,bind;,4;,Binding;
 One family of host transcription factors whose activity is altered by Tax includes NF-kappa B/Rel .,,,
 These transcription factors are post-transcriptionally regulated by their assembly with a second family of inhibitory proteins termed I kappa B that serve to sequester the NF-kappa B/Rel complexes in the cytoplasm .,,,
" Upon cellular activation , I kappa B alpha is phosphorylated , polyubiquitinated , and degraded in the proteasome .",Upon;phosphorylated;degraded;,1;10;15;,Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;Protein_catabolism;
" This proteolytic event liberates NF-kappa B , permitting its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it binds to its cognate enhancer elements .",,,
" Similarly , the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit is also post-translationally processed in the proteasome .",,,
" The mechanisms by which Tax activates NF-kappa B remain unclear , and findings presented in the literature are often controversial .",,,
 We identified a physical interaction between Tax and the HsN3 subunit of the human proteasome .,,,
 This raises the intriguing possibility that physical association of the HsN3 proteasome subunit with HTLV-I Tax coupled with the independent interaction of Tax with either p100 or p65 - I kappa B alpha targets these cytoplasmic NF-kappa B/Rel complexes to the proteasome for processing .,interaction;,21;,Binding;
 Epstein-Barr viral latency is disrupted by the immediate-early BRLF1 protein through a cell-specific mechanism .,,,
" Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B-cell malignancies .",,,
 Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology .,,,
" Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas .",,,
" It is known that expression of a single viral immediate-early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells .",expression;,5;,Gene_expression;
 Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency .,regulation;transcription;,2;5;,Regulation;Transcription;
" Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate-early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .",expression;,8;,Gene_expression;
" Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific .",,,
" Attenuated function of a variant form of the helix-loop-helix protein , Id-3 , generated by an alternative splicing mechanism .",,,
" The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding , basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation .",,,
 We report here on the identification of a 17 kDa variant of the 14 kDa Id-3 protein termed Id-3L ( long version ) which possesses a unique 60 amino acid carboxy-terminus generated by read through of a ' coding intron ' and alternative splicing .,,,
 Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor 1.1 kb Id-3L transcript together with the predominant 0.95 kb Id-3 transcript in the majority of adult human tissues analysed .,expression;,4;,Transcription;
" The variant Id-3L protein is functionally distinguishable from conventional Id-3 since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays , it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic helix-loop-helix protein , E47 , to an E box recognition sequence .",abrogate;binding;,28;29;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
 Multifactor cis - dominant negative regulation of IL-2 gene expression in anergized T cells .,expression;,10;,Gene_expression;
 The molecular mechanism underlying IL-2 transcriptional blockade in anergic T cell clones is not fully understood .,,,
" To examine whether an active negative regulatory process occurs , we created a reporter construct containing as an enhancer four copies of the NF-AT site and one copy of the octamer site ( 4X NF-AT-Oct ) .",,,
" This construct was only slightly reduced ( 1.3-fold ) in its expression when stimulated under anergic conditions , while a whole mouse IL-2 enhancer construct showed a reduction of 4.3-fold .",,,
" Addition of the -176 to -96 sequence to the 4X NF-AT-Oct construct did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy , but addition of the -236 to -96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the -150 AP-1 binding site ( -152 to -147 ) is required to mediate the effect .",,,
 Mutational studies of the -236 to -96 sequence indicated that the presence of both the -130 AP-1-like site ( -187 to -181 ) and the -150 proximal AP-1 site were necessary to observe anergy .,,,
" Because the -180 site is not required for trans-activation , it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL-2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction .",,,
 The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple transcription factors that exert a cis-acting dominant negative regulatory effect on the trans-activation of the IL-2 gene .,exert;trans-activation;,21;30;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Here we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF promoter and enhancer also encompass binding sites for core-binding factor ( CBF ) .,binding;,13;,Binding;
" Significantly , the CBF sites are in each case contained within the minimum essential core regions required for inducible activation of transcription .",,,
" Furthermore , these core regions of the enhancer and promoter each encompass closely linked binding sites for CBF , AP-1 , and NFATp .",binding;,15;,Binding;
 The GM-CSF promoter CBF site TGTGGTCA is located 51 bp upstream of the transcription start site and also overlaps a YY-1 binding site .,,,
 A 2-bp mutation within the CBF site resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in the activities of both a 69-bp proximal promoter fragment and a 627-bp full-length promoter fragment .,,,
" Stepwise deletions into the proximal promoter also revealed that the CBF site , but not the YY-1 site , was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation .",,,
 The AML1 and CBF beta genes that encode CBF each have the ability to influence cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated as proto-oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia .,,,
" This study adds GM-CSF to a growing list of cytokines and receptors that are regulated by CBF and which control the growth , differentiation , and activation of hemopoietic cells .",,,

 Requirements for induction of vitamin D-mediated gene regulation in normal human B lymphocytes .,,,
" Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 ) in that vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are not constitutively expressed , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up-regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand .",expressed;required;up-regulation;reactivity;,26;34;38;44;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Binding;

 Analysis of the ligand - binding domain of human retinoic acid receptor alpha by site-directed mutagenesis .,binding;,6;,Binding;
" Three subtypes of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) , termed RAR alpha , RAR beta , and RAR gamma , have been described .",,,

" In this study , we examined the functional role of cysteine and arginine residues in the ligand-binding domain of hRAR alpha ( hRAR alpha - LBD , amino acids 154 to 462 ) .",,,
" All conserved cysteine and arginine residues in this domain were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis , and the mutant proteins were characterized by blocking reactions , ligand-binding experiments , transactivation assays , and protease mapping .",,,
 Changes of any cysteine residue of the hRAR alpha - LBD had no significant influence on the binding of all-trans RA or 9-cis RA .,,,
" Interestingly , residue C-235 is specifically important in antagonist binding .",,,

 Selenium-mediated inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappa B and HIV-1 LTR promoter activity .,,,
 The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B is involved in the inducible expression of various inflammatory genes as well as in HIV-1 replication .,,,
" Activation of NF-kappa B is induced by prooxidants and several stimuli eliciting oxidative stress , such as cytokines , lipopolysaccharide , UV irradiation and other mediators .",,,
 Various antioxidants inhibit NF-kappa B activation in response to these stimuli .,,,
" In this study , we have investigated the effects of selenium , an integral component of glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) , on NF-kappa B activation .",,,
" In selenium-deprived Jurkat and ESb-L T lymphocytes , supplementation of selenium led to a substantial increase of GPX activity .",increase;,16;,Positive_regulation;
 Analysis of DNA binding revealed that NF-kappa B activation in response to TNF was significantly inhibited under these conditions .,,,
" Likewise , reporter gene assays using luciferase constructs driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat showed a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B controlled gene expression by selenium .",,,
" The effects of selenium were specific for NF-kappa B , since the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 was not suppressed .",,,
 These data suggest that selenium supplementation may be used to modulate the expression of NF-kappa B target genes and HIV-1 .,,,
 Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of erythroid gene expression in anthracycline-induced differentiation of human erythroleukemic cells .,,,
 Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the human leukemic cell line K562 .,,,
" Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of genes encoding gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis .",increased;expression;,7;8;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" By using run-on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including gamma-globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA-1 transcription factor .",transcription;transcription;,15;30;,Transcription;Transcription;
" In contrast , in DOX-treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells .",unchanged;,15;,Regulation;
" In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did not affect the half-lives of these mRNAs .",,,
" Because the increase in erythroid mRNA steady-state level in anthracycline-treated cells was inhibited by cycloheximide , this suggests that transcriptional activation in ACLA-treated cells and mRNA stabilization in DOX-treated cells were dependent on de novo protein synthesis .",,,
" Finally , GATA-1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA-treated but not in DOX-treated cells .",increased;,10;,Positive_regulation;
" These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , appeared to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms .",,,
" Indeed , erythroid gene expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionally by DOX .",,,
 Human TAFII 105 is a cell type-specific TFIID subunit related to hTAFII130 .,,,
 We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells .,,,
" Here , we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types .",,,
" The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and oTAFII110 , while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly .",,,
" All cells tested express TAFII105 mRNA , but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID .",express;associated;,4;17;,Transcription;Binding;
 Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells .,overexpression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells .,,,
 IL-12-induced activation of NK and T cells occurs in the absence of immediate-early activation gene expression .,,,
" The responses of lymphocytes to IL-2 and IL-12 , involving proliferation , differentiation , and cytokine production , are only partially overlapping , and may depend on induced differential expression of specific sets of genes .",,,
" Using reverse-transcription PCR differential display , we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL-2 - but not IL-12-stimulated NK cells .",,,
" This was identified as the mRNA encoding the transcription factor egr-1 , which is expressed with fast kinetics in T and NK cells upon IL-2 , but not IL-12 , stimulation .",expressed;,15;,Gene_expression;
" Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2 , but not IL-12 , whereas expression of c-jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine .",expressed;upon;expression;modified;,21;22;37;44;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" Accordingly , increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity were detected exclusively in IL-2 - stimulated cells .",,,

 Induction of activator protein ( AP ) -1 and nuclear factor-kappaB by CD28 stimulation involves both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and acidic sphingomyelinase signals .,stimulation;,14;,Positive_regulation;
" A major obstacle in understanding the signaling events that follow CD28 receptor ligation arises from the fact that CD28 acts as a costimulus to TCR engagement , making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of CD28 signals as distinct from those of the TCR .",ligation;,13;,Binding;
" To overcome this problem , we have exploited the observation that activated human T cell blasts can be stimulated via the CD28 surface molecule in the absence of antigenic challenge ; thus , we have been able to observe the response of normal T cells to CD28 activation in isolation .",activation;,48;,Positive_regulation;

" However , subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) complexes , but not NF-AT .",,,
" In contrast , engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen , either with or without CD28 ligation , resulted in the induction of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production .",ligation;induction;production;,18;23;35;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Using selective inhibitors , we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the CD28 - mediated induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB .",,,

" In contrast , AP-1 generation was inhibited by wortmannin and was also variably sensitive to chloroquine .",,,
" These data suggest that in activated normal T cells , CD28 - derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF-kappaB and AP-1 generation , and that this response uses both acidic sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-linked pathways .",,,
 A critical role of Sp1 - and Ets-related transcription factors in maintaining CTL-specific expression of the mouse perforin gene .,role;expression;,3;14;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 This study was designed to determine the potential cis-elements involved in transcriptional regulation of the mouse perforin gene .,involved;,10;,Regulation;
 DNase I hypersensitive site ( DHS ) mapping revealed that the perforin locus contained six DHS within 7.0 kb of the 5' upstream sequence ( -7.0 kb ) and two DHS in intron 2 .,,,
 The six 5' upstream and one intronic DHS were detected in only perforin - expressing lymphocytes .,expressing;,15;,Gene_expression;
 Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activities directed by 5' upstream promoter were detected preferentially in perforin-expressing cell lines .,directed;,7;,Regulation;

 Soluble factors secreted by activated T-lymphocytes modulate the transcription of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta 2 in glial cells .,modulate;transcription;,7;9;,Regulation;Transcription;
 Coordination of the immune response to injury or disease in the brain is postulated to involve bi-directional discourse between the immune system and the central nervous system .,,,
" This cross communication involves soluble mediators , including various growth factors , cytokines , and neuropeptides .",,,
" In this report , we demonstrate that the supernatant from activated T-lymphocytes is able to induce the transcription of a potent cytokine , TGF-beta 2 in glial cells .",induce;transcription;,16;18;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 The activating stimulus invokes signaling mechanisms distinct from known kinase or protease pathways .,,,

" Although GLRP shares some characteristics with the inducible transcription factor AP-1 , it appears to be distinct from known AP-1 family members .",,,

 Regulation of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression by glucocorticoids .,,,
 Glucocorticoids ( GCS ) profoundly inhibit several aspects of T cell immunity largely through inhibition of cytokine expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .,,,
" GCS were also reported to act indirectly by inducing transforming growth factor-beta expression , which in turn blocks T cell immunity .",inducing;expression;,9;13;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" In exerting their antiproliferative effects , GCS diffuse into target cells where they bind their cytoplasmic receptor , which in turn translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits transcription of cytokine genes through direct binding to the glucocorticoid response elements ( GRE ) , which are located in the promoter region of cytokine genes or , alternatively , through antagonism of the action of transcription factors required for optimal transcriptional activation .",,,
" In contrast to their inhibitory effects on cytokine expression , GCS up-regulate cytokine receptor expression that correlates with enhanced cytokine effects on target cells .",,,
" In this review , we summarize the current state of knowledge of the mechanism of action of GCS , including the phenomenon of steroid-induced rebound , which ensues upon GCS withdrawal .",,,
 The Oct-2 transcription factor .,,,
 The Oct-2 transcription factor is a member of the POU ( Pit-Oct-Unc ) family of transcription factors and is expressed only in B lymphocytes and in neuronal cells but not in other cell types .,expressed;,20;,Gene_expression;
 The primary RNA transcript of the gene is subject to alternative splicing to yield different variants which can either activate or repress gene expression .,subject;,9;,Regulation;
 The forms produced in B lymphocytes have a predominantly activating effect on gene expression whereas those produced in neuronal cells have a predominantly inhibitory effect and can repress the expression of both the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes and the cellular tyrosine hydroxylase gene .,expression;repress;expression;,14;28;30;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Thus Oct-2 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular gene expression in both B cells and neuronal cells as well as in the control of viral latency .,,,

" This putative human IL-2rE , designated PRRIII , confers IL-2 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .",,,
 PRRIII contains a Stat protein binding site that overlaps with an EBS motif ( GASd/EBSd ) .,,,
 These are essential for IL-2 inducibility of PRRIII / CAT reporter constructs .,,,
 IL-2 induced the binding of Stat5a and b proteins to the human GASd element .,,,

 The deranged cholesterol feedback mechanism has been widely recognised in initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) .,,,
" Consequently , the present study was addressed to understand this phenomenon and revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients .",,,
" However , this factor appeared when the CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through alpha-interferon therapy .",,,

 Lymphocytes from CML patients lack a 47 kDa factor having affinity for a genomic sterol regulatory sequence .,,,
 Deranged cellular cholesterol homeostasis has been widely recognized in the initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) .,,,

 These contained the luciferase gene under the control of either the human IL2 upstream enhancer region ( segments -326 to +45 ) or three repeats of the NFAT element contained within it ( segments -255 to -285 ) .,,,
 Expression of luciferase in these cells was induced by phorbol myristate acetate plus a calcium ionophore .,,,
" CIF inhibited induction of either construct as did cyclosporine , which is known to block activation of the NFAT element .",,,
 CIF failed to inhibit several other enhancer elements .,,,

 Octamer independent activation of transcription from the kappa immunoglobulin germline promoter .,,,
 Previous analyses of immunoglobulin V region promoters has led to the discovery of a common octamer motif which is functionally important in the tissue-specific and developmentally regulated transcriptional activation of immunoglobulin genes .,,,
 The germline promoters ( Ko ) located upstream of the J region gene segments of the kappa locus also contain an octamer motif ( containing a single base pair mutation and referred to as the variant octamer ) which has been shown previously to bind Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors in vitro .,bind;,45;,Binding;
" To further elucidate the role of this variant octamer motif in the regulation of germline transcription from the unrearranged kappa locus , we have quantitated the relative binding affinity of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the variant octamer motif and determined the functional role of this octamer motif in transcriptional activation .",,,
" We find that , although the variant octamer motif binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 in vitro with 5-fold lower affinity than the consensus octamer motif , mutation of the variant octamer motif to either a consensus octamer or non-octamer motif has no effect on transcriptional activation from the germline promoter .",binds;,10;,Binding;
 We also find significant differences in activation of germline and V region promoters by kappa enhancers .,,,
 Our results suggest that the germline promoters and V region promoters differ in their dependence on octamer for activation and respond differently to enhancer activation .,,,
 These findings have important implications in regulation of germline transcription as well as concomitant activation of the V-J recombination of the kappa light chain locus .,,,

" IL-4 and IL-13 up-regulated the expression of both genomic and spliced HIV mRNA in monocytes cultured on Teflon , as determined by Northern analysis and p24 Ag assay .",,,
" Using a nuclear run-on assay , IL-4 stimulation was shown to enhance transcription by two- to threefold .",,,
 IL-4 stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation and binding before enhancement of HIV RNA expression .,,,
" Conversely , IL-4 and IL-13 markedly and significantly inhibited HIV replication at the transcriptional level in monocyte-derived macrophages , and this occurred whether these cytokines were added before or after HIV infection .",,,
 The reversal from stimulation to inhibition occurred after 3 to 5 days of adherence to plastic .,,,
 IL-4 had no significant effect on HIV reverse transcription .,,,

 A novel SP-1 site in the human interleukin-1 beta promoter confers preferential transcriptional activity in keratinocytes .,,,
" To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) in non-monocytic cells , we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments .",,,
 We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes .,,,
 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes .,,,
" By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift , transcription factor SP-1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element .",bind;,25;,Binding;
 The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif .,,,
" Mutation of this motif almost completely , and specifically , abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95 % decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta ( -170/+108 ) .",,,
" Likewise , activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site .",,,
 These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes .,participate;,15;,Positive_regulation;

 V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 suppresses interleukin 2 - induced T cell growth [ published erratum appears in AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 1997 May 1;13(7):633 ],,,

 Interaction of transcription factors RFX1 and MIBP1 with the gamma motif of the negative regulatory element of the hepatitis B virus core promoter .,Interaction;,1;,Binding;
 The negative regulatory element ( NRE ) of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) core promoter contains three subregions which act synergistically to suppress core promoter activity .,,,
" One of these subregions , NRE gamma , is active in both HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells and was found to be bound by a protein factor present in both cell types .",,,

 Differentiation-dependent expression of a human carboxylesterase in monocytic cells and transcription factor binding to the promoter .,,,
 Carboxylesterases play an important role in defense and clearance mechanisms of the monocyte/macrophage system .,,,
 During the differentiation process of cells from the monocytic cell line THP-1 we observed a transient transcriptional upregulation of a human carboxylesterase analyzed by means of Northern blots .,,,
 In PMA-treated THP-1 cells we could detect three major transcription initiation sites as revealed by Nuclease Protection Assay carried out with two overlapping antisense RNA probes .,,,
 We have recently cloned the carboxylesterase upstream sequence and showed its basal promoter activity in CHO cells .,,,

" However , although NFAT DNA binding is similarly induced in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells upon antigen stimulation , only the NFAT complexes present in eTh2 cells are able to mediate high-level transcription , and relatively little NFAT transcriptional activity was induced in eTh1 cells .",,,

 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates more efficiently in vitro in differentiated macrophages than in freshly isolated monocytes .,,,
 We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of NF-kappaB with monocyte differentiation .,,,
 We demonstrated that constitutive expression of NF-kappaB in primary human monocytes changed significantly with differentiation in vitro to monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) and differentiation in vivo to alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) .,,,

 The replacement of p50 homodimers with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection during in vitro culture .,,,

 A T cell-specific enhancer in the interleukin-3 locus is activated cooperatively by Oct and NFAT elements within a DNase I-hypersensitive site .,,,

 A negative regulatory region containing a glucocorticosteroid response element ( nGRE ) in the human interleukin-1beta gene .,,,

" Within this region , a 19-bp nuclear factor binding site ( -570 to -552 ) was characterized by DNase I footprinting and electromobility shift assay .",,,
 A consensus sequence for a negative glucocorticoid response element ( nGRE ) and a transcription activator protein-2 binding site were noted within this footprint .,,,
 Functional studies showed a 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity when this 19-bp binding site was deleted in the reporter constructs IL-1beta / CAT and IL-1beta / SV40 promoter / CAT .,,,

 NF-kappa B is an important transcription factor required for T cell proliferation and other immunological functions .,,,
 The NF-kappa B1 gene encodes a 105-kD protein that is the precursor of the p50 component of NF-kappa B .,,,

" Differentiation of U-937 promonocytic cells by etoposide and ICRF-193 , two antitumour DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors with different mechanisms of action .",,,
" We have compared the action on U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells of two DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors , namely the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide and the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193 .",,,
" One hour pulse-treatment with 3 microM etoposide caused topoisomerase associated , primary DNA breakage , which was rapidly followed by apoptosis .",,,
" By contrast , these effects were not observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 microM ICRF-193 .",,,
" However , continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide ( 0.15 microM ) and ICRF-193 ( 0.3 microM ) produced several similar effects , namely decreased cell proliferation , accumulation of cells at G2 , increase in cell mass , and induction of differentiation .",,,
" Under these conditions , etoposide produced a biphasic activation of protein kinase C , which consisted in an early transient activation ( from hours 1 to 6 ) of the membrane-bound enzyme followed by a later activation ( hour 48 ) of the total , membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme .",,,
" By contrast , ICRF-193 only provoked a late activation ( from hours 72 to 96 ) of the total enzyme .",,,
" When used at differentiation-inducing concentrations , both topoisomerase inhibitors caused a great stimulation of AP-1 binding activity , with maximum value at hour 12 in etoposide-treated cells and at hour 48 in ICRF-193-treated cells .",,,

" It is concluded that topoisomerase II inhibitors may induce the differentiation of promonocytic cells , independently of their capacity to cause DNA strand breaks .",,,

 Nuclear Rel-A and c-Rel protein complexes are differentially distributed within human thymocytes .,distributed;,9;,Localization;
 Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel proteins are inducible transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular genes .,,,
 They are particularly abundant in lymphoid tissues and are thought to be critical for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .,,,
 We have reported previously that a nuclear NF-kappa B activity was present in freshly extracted human thymocytes in the absence of in vitro treatment of these cells .,,,
" In the present report , we identified NF-kappa B proteins extracted from human thymocyte nuclei as being p50 / p65 and p50 / c-Rel complexes .",,,
 Immunochemical and immunofluorescent staining of thymus sections using specific Abs allowed visualization of nuclear NF-kappa B proteins in both thymocytes and nonthymocyte cells .,,,
" This detection suggested a preferential activation of p50 / c-Rel in medullary thymocytes , whereas p50 / p65 was present in both cortical and medullary regions of human thymus lobules .",activation;present;,6;20;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

" p65 , p50 , and c-Rel activities were found in both CD4 - and CD8-positive thymocytes .",found;,9;,Gene_expression;
 These observations suggest that p65 and c-Rel complexes play distinct roles in gene expression and that both forms of NF-kappa B play critical roles during late stages of the intrathymic maturation of T cells .,,,
 Alteration of a single serine in the basic domain of the Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein separates its functions of transcriptional activation and disruption of latency .,,,
 The ZEBRA protein from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) activates a switch from the latent to the lytic expression program of the virus .,,,
" ZEBRA , a member of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins , is a transcriptional activator capable of inducing expression from viral lytic cycle promoters .",,,
 It had previously been thought that ZEBRA 's capacity to disrupt EBV latency resided primarily in its ability to activate transcription of genes that encode products required for lytic replication .,,,
" We generated a point mutant of ZEBRA , Z(S186A) , that was not impaired in its ability to activate transcription ; however , this mutation abolished its ability to initiate the viral lytic cascade .",,,
" The mutant , containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein , bound to several known ZEBRA - binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA - responsive promoters but did not disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines .",,,
" Therefore , initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the ZEBRA protein requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation ; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the DNA-binding domain of ZEBRA abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the ZEBRA protein in disruption of EBV latency .",,,
" The additional function that is required for initiation of the lytic viral life cycle is likely to require phosphorylation of serine 186 of the ZEBRA protein , which may influence either DNA recognition or transcriptional activation of lytic viral promoters in a chromatinized viral episome .",phosphorylation;influence;recognition;,19;30;33;,Phosphorylation;Regulation;Binding;
 Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated U937 cells .,,,
" During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) interacts with monocyte/macrophage receptors , resulting in the generation of inflammatory cytokines .",,,
 Transcription factor NF-kappaB is crucial in activating the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines .,,,
" In this paper , we demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in a promonocytic cell line ( U937 ) followed a rather slow kinetics , depending on the rate of IkappaB-alpha inhibitor hydrolysis .",,,
 No degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions .,,,
" The transduction pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF-kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide .",,,
 This ROS pathway was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors .,,,
 This finding indicates that phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase are also involved .,,,
" However , the NF-kappaB activation pathway involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did not seem to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells .",,,
 Possible role of nuclear factor-kappa B activity in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line .,,,
" Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) plays a broad role in gene regulation , but it is not evident whether NF-kappa B acts as a messenger system for germline C epsilon transcription .",,,
" We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) or anti - CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) participates in NF-kappa B activation responsible for germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 .",,,
" Both IL-4 and anti - CD40 mAb induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-kinase ) , translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C , and nuclear expression of NF-kappa B .",,,
" All such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002 , a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase .",,,
" In addition , N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , decreased NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4 , anti - CD40 mAb , or their combination .",,,
" NAC was also effective in diminishing germline C epsilon transcription , and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with IL-4 and anti - CD40 mAb than in those stimulated with IL-4 alone .",,,
 These results indicate that IL-4 and ligation of CD40 induce NF-kappa B expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the PI3-kinase pathway and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating germline C epsilon transcription .,ligation;,7;,Binding;
 T-lymphocytes from individuals with filarial inflammatory disease have increased transendothelial migration in vitro .,,,
 The in vitro transendothelial migration of circulating filarial antigen-specific T-cells was examined in Wuchereria banerofti infection .,,,
 Circulating T-cells from individuals with filaria-induced lymphatic pathology ( LP ) had significantly greater migration through unstimulated HUVEC monolayers than did T-cells from asymptomatic infected ( MF ) individuals ( P = 0.04 ) .,,,
" In contrast to the MF individuals where no effect was seen , transendothelial migration of 48-hr filarial antigen stimulated T-cells from LP individuals was significantly ( P = 0.01 ) greater than migration of 48-hr media-stimulated T-cells .",,,
" In six of seven patients examined , inhibition of the VLA-4 / VCAM-1 pathway resulted in greater than 50 % inhibition of transendothelial migration of T-cells .",,,
 Suppression by azelastine hydrochloride of NF-kappa B activation involved in generation of cytokines and nitric oxide .,,,
 The influence of the anti-allergy agent azelastine hydrochloride ( Azeptin ) on NF-kappa B activation associated with the generation of cytokines and nitric oxide ( NO ) was investigated in various kinds of human and mouse cells .,,,
 Azeptin dose-dependently suppressed both DNA and protein synthesis in human gingival fibroblasts ( HF ) and also suppressed blastogenesis of human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) .,,,
" Generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin 1-beta , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6 from 10(-5) M Azeptin-treated PBL and human monocytes ( HM ) was decreased to approximately 1/3 to 2/3 of the control levels .",Generation;decreased;,1;27;,Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;
" In parallel with the decreased cytokine generation , each cytokine mRNA was less expressed in the presence of 10(-5) M Azeptin .",,,
" In addition , both inducible nitric oxide synthase - mRNA level and NO generation in mouse peritoneal macrophages were suppressed by 10(-5) M Azeptin .",inducible;suppressed;,5;20;,Transcription;Negative_regulation;
" Being compatible with those results , Azeptin ( 10(-5) M ) suppressed activation of NF-kappa B in PBL , HM and HF .",,,
 These results appear to indicate that suppression of cytokine and NO generation by Azeptin results at least partially from the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 The T cell activation factor NF-ATc positively regulates HIV-1 replication and gene expression in T cells .,,,
 Clinical deterioration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is associated with increased levels of viral replication and burden in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs .,,,
 T cell activation and ensuing cellular gene activation can be critical for HIV-1 replication .,,,
 The hypothesis that the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) may influence HIV-1 replication is therefore compelling given the tight correlation of HIV-1 transcriptional induction to T cell activation .,,,
" We report that certain NF-AT(Rel) family members productively bind the kappaB regulatory elements , synergize with NF-kappaB and Tat in transcriptional activation of HIV-1 , and enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells .",,,
 These results link regulatory factors critical to T cell commitment directly to HIV-1 replication .,,,
 Differentiation of T-helper lymphocytes : selective regulation by members of the STAT family of transcription factors .,,,
 Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) control the differentiation of T-helper cells .,,,
 Here we summarize studies which investigate the mechanism by which these cytokines selectively reprogramme gene expression in T-lymphocytes .,,,
 Cytokine stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of the corresponding cytokine receptor .,,,
" These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for latent , cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) proteins .",,,
 Receptor/Stat interaction is mediated by the src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain of the corresponding Stat protein .,,,
" Although Stat binding to the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptor strongly depends on the phosphotyrosine residue , the recruitment of a specific Stat protein is dictated by amino acid residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine .",,,
 Specific docking sites within individual cytokine receptors have been identified for almost all Stat proteins .,,,
 The direct coupling between cytokine receptor and transcription factor helps to explain how different cytokines elicit distinct patterns of gene expression .,,,

 Physical interactions between Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins play an important role in their cooperative activation of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in T cells .,,,
 The transcriptional regulatory elements of many inducible T-cell genes contain adjacent or overlapping binding sites for the Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT families of transcription factors .,,,
" Similar arrays of functionally important NF-kappaB/NFAT and Ets binding sites are present in the transcriptional enhancers of human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) , suggesting that this pattern of nuclear protein binding sites reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating inducible T-cell gene expression that has been co-opted during HIV evolution .",,,
" Despite these findings , the molecular mechanisms by which Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins cooperatively regulate inducible T-cell gene expression remained unknown .",,,
" In the studies described in this report , we demonstrated a physical interaction between multiple Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins both in vitro and in activated normal human T cells .",,,
 This interaction is mediated by the Ets domain of Ets proteins and the C-terminal region of the Rel homology domains of NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins .,,,
" In addition , the Ets-NF-kappaB/NFAT interaction requires the presence of DNA binding sites for both proteins , as it is abolished by the DNA intercalating agents propidium iodide and ethidium bromide and enhanced by the presence of synthetic oligonucleotides containing binding sites for Ets and NF-kappaB proteins .",,,
" A dominant-negative mutant of NF-kappaB p50 that binds DNA but fails to interact with Ets proteins inhibits the synergistic activation of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers by NF-kappaB ( p50 + p65 ) and Ets-1 , suggesting that physical interaction between Ets and NF-kappaB proteins is required for the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers .",binds;,8;,Binding;
" Taken together , these findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved physical interactions between Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins are important in regulating the inducible expression of T-cell genes and viruses .",,,

 Oxidant-regulation of gene expression in the chronically inflamed intestine .,,,
" It is becoming increasingly apparent that the chronic gut inflammation observed in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases ( e.g. ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) is associated with enhanced production of leukocyte-derived oxidants .",,,
 Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide are known to activate certain transcription factors such as nuclear transcription factor kappa beta .,,,
 Nuclear transcription factor kB ( NF-kappa B ) is a ubiquitous transcription factor and pleiotropic regulator of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses .,,,
" This transcription factor is activated via the selective phosphorylation , ubiquination and degradation of its inhibitor protein I-kB thereby allowing translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus where it upregulates the transcription of a variety of adhesion molecules ( e.g. ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 ) , cytokines ( TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 ) and enzymes ( iNOS ) .",transcription;upregulates;transcription;,2;30;32;,Transcription;Regulation;Transcription;
 The proteolytic degradation of the post-translationally modified I-kappa B is known to be mediated by the 26S proteasome complex .,,,

" Unlike full-sized NOTCH1 , two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain ( DeltaE ) or consisting only of the intracellular domain ( ICN ) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells , presumably through RBP-Jkappa response elements within DNA .",,,
 Both truncated forms also bound to the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa in extracts prepared from human and murine T-ALL cell lines .,bound;,5;,Binding;
 Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak RBP-Jkappa - binding site within the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain .,,,
" Unexpectedly , a second , stronger RBP-Jkappa - binding site , which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-Jkappa , was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation .",augments;association;,25;26;,Positive_regulation;Binding;
" While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus , DeltaE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , suggesting that intranuclear localization is not essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation .",,,
" In support of this interpretation , mutation of putative nuclear localization sequences decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by membrane-bound DeltaE .",localization;decreased;localization;,11;13;15;,Localization;Negative_regulation;Localization;
 Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of membrane-bound DeltaE was approximately equivalent to that produced by intranuclear ICN .,,,
 These data are most consistent with NOTCH1 oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with RBP-Jkappa at promoter sites .,association;,15;,Binding;
 Transcriptional induction of collagenase-1 in differentiated monocyte-like ( U937 ) cells is regulated by AP-1 and an upstream C/EBP-beta site .,regulated;,13;,Regulation;

 A novel genetic system to isolate a dominant negative effector on DNA - binding activity of Oct-2 .,binding;,14;,Binding;
 Recent studies have revealed that interactions between transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells .,,,
" To isolate cDNA clones that dominantly inhibit the DNA - binding activity of Oct-2 , chosen as a representative factor , we have developed a novel screening system .",inhibit;binding;,7;11;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
" This employs an Escherichia coli tester strain carrying a modified lac operon as a reporter gene , with the lac operator sequence replaced by an octamer sequence .",,,

 A negative role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T-cell antigen receptor function .,,,
 BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms during T-cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response .,,,
" Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function , including the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , the costimulatory receptor CD28 , and negative regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4 .",activated;,8;,Positive_regulation;
 PI 3-kinase is also regulated by the haematopoietic cytokines that determine T-cell differentiation and lymphocyte proliferation .,regulated;,5;,Regulation;
 PI 3-kinase can thus dynamically influence the outcome of the immune reactions at various stages .,,,
" In this study , we investigated the importance of PI 3-kinase in TCR-directed T-cell activation using activated or inhibitory versions of PI 3-kinase .",,,
 RESULTS : Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were not affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase .,expression;,25;,Gene_expression;
" We found , however , that PI 3-kinase profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of ' nuclear factor of activated T cells ' ( NF-AT ) elicited by the TCR : expression of an activated form of PI 3-kinase inhibited TCR-mediated NF-AT responses , whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase potently enhanced TCR-controlled NF-AT induction .",expression;expression;,31;45;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
" These effects of PI 3-kinase were not mediated by previously identified PI 3-kinase effectors , such as protein kinase B , a positive regulator of PI 3-kinase , or the GTPase Rac , and are therefore likely to involve a novel , as yet unknown , effector molecule .",,,
" CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish that PI 3-kinase can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function , and uncover a previously unrecognized function for PI 3-kinase in T cells as a selective negative regulator of TCR-signalling events and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis .",,,
 NF-kappa B-independent suppression of HIV expression by ascorbic acid .,,,
 Ascorbic acid ( ascorbate or vitamin C ) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in latently infected T lymphocytic cells following stimulation with a tumor promoter ( PMA ) and inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-alpha ) .,,,
" To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor , NF-kappa B , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or absence of ascorbate , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine ( AZT ) .",,,
" Pretreatment of ACH-2 T cells by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA , TNF-alpha , or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) resulted in strong suppression of NF-kappa B activation .",,,
" In contrast , neither ascorbate nor AZT affected NF-kappa B activity under all three induction conditions in the ACH-2 cell line .",,,
 Ascorbate and AZT also had no effect on NF-kappa B activation following TNF-alpha - or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells .,,,
" These results suggest that the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is not mediated via NF-kappa B inhibition , unlike that seen with other antioxidants .",,,
 Lineage- and stage-specific expression of runt box polypeptides in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis .,,,
 Translocations involving the human CBFA2 locus have been associated with leukemia .,,,
" This gene , originally named AML1 , is a human homologue of the Drosophila gene runt that controls early events in fly embryogenesis .",,,
" To clarify the role of mammalian runt products in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis , we have studied their pattern of expression in mouse hematopoietic tissues in the adult and during ontogeny using an anti-runt box antiserum .",,,
" In the adult bone marrow , we found expression of runt polypeptides in differentiating myeloid cells and in B lymphocytes .",,,
" Within the erythroid lineage , runt expression is biphasic , clearly present in the erythroblasts of early blood islands and of the fetal liver , but absent in the adult .",expression;absent;,7;27;,Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 Biochemical analysis by Western blotting of fetal and adult hematopoietic populations shows several runt isoforms .,,,

 Cell-to-cell contact activates the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus 1 through its kappaB motif .,,,
 Cell-to-cell contact between peripheral blood lymphocytes and transfected human colonic carcinoma cell line HT29 activates transcription of the long terminal repeats ( LTR ) of human immunodeficiency virus .,,,
 HIV-1 LTR transcription is controlled by a complex array of virus-encoded and cellular proteins .,,,
" Using various constructs expressing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of the intact or three deleted forms of HIV-1 LTR , we obtained evidence that the kappaB regulatory elements located in the U3 region are involved in cell-to-cell activation of HIV-1 LTR .",,,

 HIV does not replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated with CD3 / CD28 .,,,
" In this report , we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV , LAI , does not replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated by cross-linking CD3 and CD28 .",cross-linking;,28;,Binding;
" In contrast , LAI replicates well in memory CD4 T cells stimulated in the same way .",,,
" Unlike this physiologically relevant stimulation , PHA stimulates productive LAI replication in both naive and memory T cells .",,,
 These studies were conducted with highly purified ( FACS-isolated ) subsets of CD4 T cells identified by expression of both CD45RA and CD62L .,,,
 Remixing of purified T cells showed that naive T cells do not suppress LAI replication in memory T cells and that memory T cells do not restore LAI expression in naive T cells .,,,
" The suppression of productive LAI replication in naive T cells is not due to differential expression of viral coreceptors , nor is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV transcription factors , nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 .",,,
" The inherent resistance of naive T cells to productive HIV infection , coupled with their proliferative advantage as demonstrated here , provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of CD4 T cells from HIV-infected adults .",,,
 Control of NFATx1 nuclear translocation by a calcineurin-regulated inhibitory domain .,Control;translocation;,1;5;,Regulation;Localization;
 The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) regulates cytokine gene expression in T cells through cis-acting elements located in the promoters of several cytokine genes .,,,
" NFATx1 , which is preferentially expressed in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes , is one of four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors .",expressed;,6;,Gene_expression;
 We have performed domain analysis of NFATx1 by examining the effects of deletion mutations .,,,
" We found that NFATx1 DNA binding activity and interaction with AP-1 polypeptides were dependent on its central Rel similarity region and that transcriptional activation was reduced by deletions of either its N-terminal domain or its C-terminal domain , suggesting the presence of intrinsic transcriptional activation motifs in both regions .",binding;dependent;reduced;,6;14;26;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;
 We also identified a potent inhibitory sequence within its N-terminal domain .,,,
" We show that the inactivation of the inhibition was dependent on the activity of calcineurin , a calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase .",,,
" We also show that calcineurin associated with the N-terminal domain of NFATx1 at multiple docking sites and caused a reduction of size , indicative of dephosphorylation , in NFATx1 .",associated;,6;,Binding;
" We have mapped the inhibitory activity to less than 60 residues , containing motifs that are conserved in all NFAT proteins .",,,
" Finally , we demonstrate that deletion in NFATx1 of the mapped 60 residues leads to its nuclear translocation independent of calcium signaling .",leads;translocation;independent;,14;18;19;,Positive_regulation;Localization;Positive_regulation;
 Our results support the model proposing that the N-terminal domain confers calcium-signaling dependence on NFATx1 transactivation activity by regulating its intracellular localization through a protein module that associates with calcineurin and is a target of its phosphatase activity .,regulating;localization;through;,19;22;23;,Regulation;Localization;Regulation;
 Neuronal ( type I ) nitric oxide synthase regulates nuclear factor kappaB activity and immunologic ( type II ) nitric oxide synthase expression .,regulates;expression;,9;23;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 Nitric oxide subserves diverse physiologic roles in the nervous system .,,,

 We show that nNOS is the predominant isoform constitutively expressed in glia .,expressed;,10;,Gene_expression;
 NO derived from nNOS in glia inhibits the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB ( NF kappaB ) as NOS inhibitors enhance basal NF kappaB activation .,,,
" Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) is an inhibitor of NF kappaB in most cells ; however , we show that PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC .",,,
" In Jurkat cells , a human T-cell lymphoma cell line , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) induces NF kappaB activation that is inhibited by PDTC .",,,
" Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells , PDTC did not inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha - induced NF kappaB activation in astrocytes ; instead PDTC itself induces NF kappaB activation in astrocytes , and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex .",,,
" In astrocytes PDTC also dramatically induces the NF kappaB - dependent enzyme , iNOS , supporting the physiologic relevance of endogenous NO regulation of NF kappaB .",induces;dependent;,6;11;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 NF kappaB activation in glia from mice lacking nNOS responds more rapidly to PDTC compared with astrocytes from wild-type mice .,lacking;,8;,Negative_regulation;

 Regulation of human epsilon germline transcription : role of B-cell-specific activator protein .,,,
" Germline transcripts initiate from promoters upstream of the immunoglobulin switch region , and are necessary to target the appropriate switch region for recombination and switching .",,,
 Different cytokines activate transcription at the appropriate germline promoter .,,,
" Because binding sites for B-cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) are located upstream of several switch regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster , BSAP might play a role in the regulation of germline transcription and isotype switching .",,,
 We investigated whether BSAP plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the epsilon germline promoter in human B cells .,,,
 Our results showed that BSAP plays a role in both IL-4 - dependent induction and CD40 - mediated upregulation of human epsilon germline transcription .,,,
" BSAP is unique among the transcription factors that regulate epsilon germline expression , because it is B cell specific , and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for IgE switching .",,,
 Retinoic acid-induced modulation of IL-2 mRNA production and IL-2 receptor expression on T cells .,modulation;production;,3;7;,Regulation;Transcription;
 BACKGROUND : Retinoic acid ( RA ) has important immune-modulating effects on both T and B cell function .,,,

 These results suggests that both proximal steps in CD8+ T-cell activation as well as the later phases are unresponsive to A6H ligation .,,,

 Structure and function analysis of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen promoter : evidence for the role of Sp1 and not of c-Myb or PU.1 in myelomonocytic lineage-specific expression .,role;expression;,18;30;,Regulation;Gene_expression;

 A 1-kb region of the gene that includes 5' flanking sequence was reported earlier to contain functional promoter activity and was specifically demethylated in expressing cells in contrast to null cells .,,,

 Inhibitor ( IK ) of IFN-gamma induced HLA class II antigens expression also inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression in the human Raji B cell line .,,,
 The expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens is constitutive in professional antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) but can also be induced by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) on the majority of the non professional APCs ( e.g. fibroblasts ) .,,,
 We have recently characterised a new factor called IK which is an efficient inhibitor of IFN-gamma induction of MHC class II antigens expression .,,,

 An enhancer-blocking element between alpha and delta gene segments within the human T cell receptor alpha/delta locus .,,,
 T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha and delta gene segments are organized within a single genetic locus but are differentially regulated during T cell development .,,,
" An enhancer-blocking element ( BEAD-1 , for blocking element alpha/delta 1 ) was localized to a 2.0-kb region 3' of TCR delta gene segments and 5' of TCR alpha joining gene segments within this locus .",,,
 BEAD-1 blocked the ability of the TCR delta enhancer ( Edelta ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a chromatin-integrated construct .,,,
" We propose that BEAD-1 functions as a boundary that separates the TCR alpha/delta locus into distinct regulatory domains controlled by Edelta and the TCR alpha enhancer , and that it prevents Edelta from opening the chromatin of the TCR alpha joining gene segments for VDJ recombination at an early stage of T cell development .",,,
 Quantification of vitamin D receptor mRNA by competitive polymerase chain reaction in PBMC : lack of correspondence with common allelic variants .,,,
 It has been recently claimed that polymorphism for the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) influences several aspects of calcium and bone metabolism .,,,
" To evaluate the physiologic plausibility of these claims , we compared the abundance of the VDR mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) between different VDR genotypes using a quantitative reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction-based method .",abundance;,13;,Transcription;
 The method is based on the coamplification of VDR cDNA and an internal standard consisting of known concentrations of a human VDR CDNA mutated at a BglII restriction site ; the interassay coefficient of variation is 11 % .,,,

" The concentration of the VDR mRNA was 10(-8) to 10(-7) g/g of total RNA in cell-sorted monocytes and in in vitro activated lymphocytes , but only 10(-12) g/g of total mRNA in resting lymphocytes , establishing that the VDR mRNA determined by our method in PBMCs is due to constitutive expression in monocytes .",expression;,51;,Transcription;

 Tap : a novel cellular protein that interacts with tip of herpesvirus saimiri and induces lymphocyte aggregation .,,,
 Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with Lck and down-regulates Lck - mediated activation .,associates;,5;,Binding;
 We identified a novel cellular Tip-associated protein ( Tap ) by a yeast two-hybrid screen .,,,
 Tap associated with Tip following transient expression in COS-1 cells and stable expression in human Jurkat-T cells .,,,
 Expression of Tip and Tap in Jurkat-T cells induced dramatic cell aggregation .,,,

" Transactivation by CIITA , the type II bare lymphocyte syndrome-associated factor , requires participation of multiple regions of the TATA box binding protein .",,,
 CIITA is a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines .,defective;,20;,Negative_regulation;
 Its N-terminal region is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a DNA binding domain .,,,
 We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation .,,,
 Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( TATA box binding protein ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in TBP known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors .,disrupt;interaction;,31;33;,Negative_regulation;Binding;
 Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in TBP that in yeast is known to abolish VP16 - mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected .,,,
 A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP - associated factor TAFII250 also failed to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain .,interaction;,6;,Binding;
 Certain interactions between TBP and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA - mediated transactivation to reach its full potential .,interactions;,2;,Binding;

" Co-stimulation of microglia with suboptimal concentrations of A beta(25-35) and 100 U/ml IFN gamma resulted in the detection of a specific NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel mobility shift assays .",,,
 This response required at least 120 min to be evident and supershift experiments revealed that the NF-kappa B complex contains both RelA and p50 .,,,

 Characterization of the cellular transcription factors interacting with the human T cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is essential to dissecting the mechanisms involved in viral transcription that may be pertinent to the oncogenic and neuropathogenic processes associated with HTLV-I infection in both the immune and nervous systems .,,,
" Electrophoretic mobility shift ( EMS ) analyses utilizing oligonucleotides homologous to each of the 21 bp repeat elements reacted with nuclear extracts derived from cell lines of lymphocytic , monocytic , neuronal , and glial cell origin have demonstrated differential binding of cellular factors to the three 21 bp repeats ( 1-4 ) .",,,
 ATF/CREB and Sp family members interacted with the 21 bp repeats to form DNA-protein complexes common to all cell types examined .,,,

 Role of the X2 box in activated transcription from the DRA promoter in B cells .,,,
 We investigated the function of the evolutionary conserved X2 box in the promoter of the HLA-DRA gene from the human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) in resting and activated B cells .,,,
" NF-X2 , which contains members of the AP-1/ATF/CREB families of transcription factors , interacts with the X2 box ( 5'-TGCGTCA-3' ) from positions -97 to -91 in the DRA promoter .",,,
" In resting Raji cells , little to no binding to the X2 box was observed .",,,
" In sharp contrast , in B cells treated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , strong interactions between the X2 box and NF-X2 containing c-Fos were observed .",,,
" As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses , the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) also increased rates of transcription from the wild-type DRA promoter but not from a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the X2 box .",,,
" Since the co-expression with a dominant negative c-Fos abolished the responsiveness to TPA , we conclude that activated transcription of the DRA gene depends on interactions between the X2 box and NF-X2 , which contains c-Fos .",co-expression;,3;,Gene_expression;

" In contrast , IFN-alpha/beta rescued T cell clones from apoptosis without active proliferation , and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins tested so far was unaffected .",,,

 Transcription factor binding sites downstream of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription start site are important for virus infectivity .,,,
" When transcriptionally active , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter contains a nucleosome-free region encompassing both the promoter/enhancer region and a large region ( 255 nucleotides [ nt ] ) downstream of the transcription start site .",,,
" We have previously identified new binding sites for transcription factors downstream of the transcription start site ( nt 465 to 720 ) : three AP-1 sites ( I , II , and III ) , an AP3-like motif ( AP3-L ) , a downstream binding factor ( DBF ) site , and juxtaposed Sp1 sites .",,,
" Here , we show that the DBF site is an interferon-responsive factor ( IRF ) binding site and that the AP3-L motif binds the T-cell-specific factor NF-AT .",,,
 Mutations that abolish the binding of each factor to its cognate site are introduced in an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone to study their effect on HIV-1 transcription and replication .,,,
 Individual mutation of the DBF or AP3-L site as well as the double mutation AP-1(III)/AP3-L did not affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus .,,,
" In contrast , proviruses carrying mutations in the Sp1 sites were totally defective in terms of replication .",,,
" Virus production occurred with slightly delayed kinetics for viruses containing combined mutations in the AP-1(III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites and in the AP3-L and DBF-sites , whereas viruses mutated in the AP-1(I,II,III) and AP3-L sites and in the AP-1(I,II,III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites exhibited a severely defective replicative phenotype .",,,
 No RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA .,,,
 Measurement of the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter after transient transfection of the HIV-1 provirus DNA or of long terminal repeat-luciferase constructs showed a positive correlation between the transcriptional and the replication defects for most mutants .,,,
 The role of nuclear factor-kappa B in cytokine gene regulation .,,,
 Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression .,,,
" Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a critical transcription factor for maximal expression of many cytokines that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases , such as adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and sepsis syndrome .",,,
 Activation and regulation of NF-kappa B are tightly controlled by a group of inhibitory proteins ( I kappa B ) that sequester NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm of immune/inflammatory effector cells .,,,
" NF-kappa B activation involves signaled phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteolysis of I kappa B .",,,
" Liberated NF-kappa B migrates to the nucleus , where it binds to specific promoter sites and activates gene transcription .",,,
 The activation of NF-kappa B initiates both extracellular and intracellular regulatory events that result in autoregulation of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-kappa B activation .,,,
" Recently , activation of NF-kappa B has been linked to ARDS and has been shown to be a critical proximal step in the initiation of neutrophilic inflammation in animal models .",,,
" Activation of NF-kappa B can be inhibited in vivo by treatment with antioxidants , corticosteroids , and the induction of endotoxin tolerance .",,,
 Identification of more specific and efficacious inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation might prove beneficial for the treatment of cytokine-mediated inflammatory diseases .,,,
 Role of ascorbate in the activation of NF-kappaB by tumour necrosis factor-alpha in T-cells .,,,
" The first product of ascorbate oxidation , the ascorbate free radical ( AFR ) , acts in biological systems mainly as an oxidant , and through its role in the plasma membrane redox system exerts different effects on the cell .",,,
" We have investigated the role of ascorbate , AFR and dehydroascorbate ( DHA ) in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor in Jurkat T-cells stimulated by tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .",,,
" Here we show , by electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that ascorbate increases the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA in TNF-alpha - stimulated Jurkat cells .",,,
 The ability of ascorbate to enhance cytoplasmic inhibitory IkBalpha protein degradation correlates completely with its capacity to induce NF-kappaB binding to DNA and to potentiate NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in TNF-alpha - stimulated Jurkat cells but not in cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin .,enhance;degradation;,6;11;,Positive_regulation;Protein_catabolism;
" AFR behaves like ascorbate , while DHA and ascorbate phosphate do not affect TNF-alpha - mediated NF-kappaB activation .",,,

" Pancreatic islet expression studies and polymorphic DNA markers in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 .",,,
 The genes encoding the functionally related hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha play a critical role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function .,,,
" Mutations in these liver-enriched transcription factors result in two forms of early-onset type 2 diabetes ( maturity-onset diabetes of the young [ MODY ] ) , MODY3 and MODY1 , which are characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion , early disease onset , and autosomal dominant inheritance .",,,
 The transcriptional hierarchy of HNFs suggests that other proteins of the regulatory cascade might be responsible for other forms of MODY and/or late-onset type 2 diabetes .,,,
" In this study , we show that HNF-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells .",expressed;,19;,Gene_expression;

" To identify genes that are expressed in T cells after stimulation , mRNA from T lymphocytes that had been activated by the simultaneous stimulation of the CD3 and CD28 trigger molecules was transcribed for a differential mRNA display analysis into cDNA and was compared with cDNA from CD28 - or CD3-activated or resting lymphocytes .",,,
 Differential expression was confirmed subsequently by Northern blot analysis .,,,
 One of the cDNA fragments expressed specifically in CD3- and CD28 - activated T cells was designated RP1 .,,,
" The predictive protein-coding region of RP1 had a significant homology to members of the recently found adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) protein - binding EB1 gene family , which codes for yet unknown protein(s) .",,,

 Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in monocytic cells by Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans .,,,
" Because candidiasis and cryptococcosis are common in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected persons , the effect of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans on HIV expression in monocytic cells was examined .",,,
 Stimulation of the latently HIV-infected myelomonocytic cell line OM-10.1 with C. neoformans and C. albicans in the presence of pooled human serum caused a ratio-dependent increase in HIV production .,,,
" Induction of HIV by C. neoformans was enhanced by anti-capsular antibody , while induction by both organisms was inhibited by anti - TNF-alpha antibody .",,,
" In THP-1 cells transfected with HIV plasmid constructs , both organisms induced transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat that was dependent on intact NF-kappaB binding sequences .",,,
" Thus , C. neoformans and C. albicans enhance HIV expression in monocytic cells through a TNF-alpha - and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism .",,,
" In HIV-infected patients , such enhancement may further impair host immunity and could accelerate the course of HIV disease .",,,
 Bcl-2 protein inhibits bufalin-induced apoptosis through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in human leukemia U937 cells .,,,

" In addition , the combined use of anti - Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-kappa B inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days .",,,
 The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-kappa B inhibitors alone or the anti - Tat sFv intrabodies alone .,,,
" Together , these results suggest that in future clinical gene therapy trials , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here may improve the survival of transduced cells and prolong clinical benefit .",,,
 Transcription factors in immune-mediated disease .,,,
 A large amount of detailed information about the intracellular proteins regulating NF-kappa B activation and the cellular response to NF-kappa B activation has emerged recently .,,,
" Several small molecules , an antisense oligonucleotide , and gene therapeutic agents that inhibit NF-kappa b activation have been described .",,,
" Despite this , there are still significant gaps in our understanding of this process and its consequences .",,,

 CholecystokininB receptor from human Jurkat lymphoblastic T cells is involved in activator protein-1-responsive gene activation .,,,
 The aim of this study was to analyze the role of cholecystokinin ( CCK(B) ) receptor in human lymphoblastic Jurkat T cells .,,,
 We investigated the trophic effect resulting from activation of such a receptor by using the reporter gene strategy .,activation;,8;,Positive_regulation;
" For this purpose , we transiently transfected Jurkat T cells with the reporter plasmid p[(TRE)3-tk-Luc] and found that CCK-8 was able to dose-dependently induce luciferase expression related to activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activation with a maximal response identical to that obtained with compounds known to activate AP-1 complex ( quantitatively , the same level of induction was obtained with 1 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , 100 microM diacylglycerol , or 4 nM epidermal growth factor ) .",induce;expression;,24;26;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 This effect was confirmed in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA of CCK(B) receptor cloned from Jurkat T cells .,,,

 Epstein-Barr virus binding to CD21 activates the initial viral promoter via NF-kappaB induction .,,,
" Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , an oncogenic human herpesvirus , binds to and infects normal human B lymphocytes via CD21 , the CR2 complement receptor .",,,
" Studies of the mechanisms that enable EBV to infect nonactivated , noncycling B cells provide compelling evidence for a sequence of events in which EBV binding to CD21 on purified resting human B cells rapidly activates the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which , in turn , binds to and mediates transcriptional activation of Wp , the initial viral latent gene promoter .",,,
" Thus , EBV binding to its cellular receptor on resting B cells triggers an NF-kappaB-dependent intracellular signaling pathway which is required for infection .",,,
 Activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B by phagocytic stimuli in human neutrophils .,,,
 Phagocytosis represents an important physiological trigger for the inducible expression of several genes in human neutrophils .,,,
" Here , we report that a DNA - binding activity primarily consisting of the classical NF-kappa B heterodimer , p50 / RelA , is induced in phagocytosing neutrophils .",binding;induced;,9;25;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
" Under these conditions , NF-kappa B activation was found to be a rapid and transient response , reaching a maximum by 10-15 min , and returning to near-basal levels by 30 min .",,,
" In neutrophils undergoing the phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts , the onset of NF-kappa B activation was paralleled by a decline in immunoreactive I kappa B-alpha protein levels , and the cellular I kappa B-alpha pool was replenished by 30 min , in agreement with our gel shift data .",decline;replenished;,20;37;,Negative_regulation;Negative_regulation;
 We conclude that NF-kappa B activation could constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of kappa B-responsive genes is enhanced in phagocytosing neutrophils .,,,
" To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that phagocytic stimuli can induce NF-kappa B activation in human neutrophils .",,,
 Surfactant protein A activates NF-kappa B in the THP-1 monocytic cell line .,,,
 The expression of many genes for which products are involved in inflammation is controlled by the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B .,,,
" Because surfactant protein ( SP ) A is involved in local host defense in the lung and alters immune cell function by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as surface proteins involved in inflammation , we hypothesized that SP-A exerts its action , at least in part , via activation of NF-kappa B .",,,
" We used gel shift assays to determine whether SP-A activated NF-kappa B in the THP-1 cell line , a human monocytic cell line .",,,
" Activation of NF-kappa B in THP-1 cells by SP-A doses as low as 1 microgram/ml occurred within 30 min of SP-A treatment , peaked at 60 min , and then declined .",,,
 This activation is inhibited by known inhibitors of NF-kappa B or by simultaneous treatment of the cells with surfactant lipids .,,,
" Moreover , the NF-kappa B inhibitors blocked SP-A-dependent increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels .",blocked;increases;,7;9;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 These observations suggest a mechanism by which SP-A plays a role in the pathogenesis of some lung conditions and point to potential therapeutic measures that could be used to prevent SP-A induced inflammation in the lung .,,,
 alpha-Tocopheryl succinate inhibits monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells by suppressing NF-kappa B mobilization .,,,
 The adherence of monocytes to activated endothelium is an early event in atherogenesis .,,,
" Because antioxidants have been considered to be of antiatherosclerotic potential , we investigated the effects of alpha-tocopherol ( TCP ) and its acetate and succinate esters on monocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) .",,,
" Endothelial cells were treated with TCP , alpha-tocopherol acetate ( TCP acetate ) , or alpha-tocopheryl succinate ( TCP succinate ) before stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) or interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) .",,,
" Cytokine - stimulated cell surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 , CD106 ) and E-selectin ( ELAM-1 , CD62E ) , but not of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) , was time- and dose-dependently inhibited by TCP succinate but not by TCP or TCP acetate .",stimulated;expression;inhibited;,3;6;41;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Negative_regulation;

" Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of HUVEC nuclear proteins revealed a decrease in TNF-alpha - stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation after pretreatment of HUVEC with TCP succinate but not with TCP , TCP acetate , or succinate alone .",,,
" In conclusion , we demonstrate that the vitamin E derivative TCP succinate prevents monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappa B , further emphasizing the antiatherosclerotic potential of lipid soluble antioxidants .",,,
 Distinct mechanisms for N-acetylcysteine inhibition of cytokine - induced E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression .,inhibition;induced;expression;,5;9;13;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" We have examined the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a well-characterized , thiol-containing antioxidant , on agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells ( EC ) .",,,
" NAC inhibited interleukin-1 ( IL-1 beta ) -induced , but not basal , adhesion with 50 % inhibition at approximately 20 mM .",,,
" Monocytic cell adhesion to EC in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , alpha-thrombin , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) was similarly inhibited by NAC .",,,

 NAC had no effect on the half-life of E-selectin or VCAM-1 mRNA .,,,
" Although NAC reduced nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in EC as measured by gel-shift assays using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding sites of the VCAM-1 gene ( VCAM-NF-kappa B ) , the antioxidant had no appreciable effect when an oligomer corresponding to the consensus NF-kappa B binding site of the E-selectin gene ( E-selectin - NF-kappa B ) was used .",,,
" Because NF-kappa B has been reported to be redox sensitive , we studied the effects of NAC on the EC redox environment .",,,
 NAC caused an expected dramatic increase in the reduced glutathione ( GSH ) levels in EC .,,,
" In vitro studies demonstrated that whereas the binding affinity of NF-kappa B to the VCAM-NF-kappa B oligomer peaked at a GSH-to-oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) ratio of approximately 200 and decreased at higher ratios , the binding to the E-selectin - NF-kappa B oligomer appeared relatively unaffected even at ratios > 400 , i.e. , those achieved in EC treated with 40 mM NAC .",,,
" These results suggest that NF-kappa B binding to its consensus sequences in the VCAM-1 and E-selectin gene exhibits marked differences in redox sensitivity , allowing for differential gene expression regulated by the same transcription factor .",binding;expression;regulated;,7;29;30;,Binding;Gene_expression;Regulation;
 Our data also demonstrate that NAC increases the GSH-to-GSSG ratio within the EC suggesting one possible mechanism through which this antioxidant inhibits agonist-induced monocyte adhesion to EC .,,,
 Human monocyte binding to fibronectin enhances IFN-gamma - induced early signaling events .,,,
 Leukocyte integrins are fundamentally important in modulating adhesion to extracellular matrix components and to other cells .,,,
 This integrin-mediated adhesion controls leukocyte arrest and extravasation during the onset of inflammatory responses .,,,
" Moreover , integrin-ligand interactions trigger signaling pathways that may influence leukocyte phenotype and function at sites of inflammation .",,,
" In the current studies , we evaluated the combinatorial effects of monocyte adhesion and IFN-gamma on intracellular signaling pathways .",,,
" IFN-gamma triggers a well-defined signal transduction pathway , which although not directly stimulated by monocyte adherence to fibronectin or arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) -coated substrata , was enhanced significantly in these matrix-adherent cells .",,,
" Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces , monocytes adherent to fibronectin or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of IFN-gamma - induced mRNA for the high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor .",increase;levels;induced;,23;27;31;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;Positive_regulation;

" Furthermore , the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 was enhanced significantly in RGD-adherent monocytes compared with control cells .",phosphorylation;enhanced;,5;16;,Phosphorylation;Positive_regulation;

 The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD36 is required for oxidized low-density lipoprotein modulation of NF-kappaB activity by tumor necrosis factor-alpha .,,,
" The binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( Ox LDL ) by monocyte-macrophages causes pleiotropic effects , including changes in gene expression , and is thought to represent an early event in atherogenesis .",,,
" The integral membrane glycoprotein CD36 appears to play a physiological role in binding and uptake of Ox LDL by monocyte-macrophages , although the molecular events associated with CD36 - Ox LDL interaction are unknown .",interaction;,32;,Binding;
" To approach this issue , we used CD36 transfected Chinese hampster ovary ( CHO ) cells , exposed them to Ox LDL , and determined changes in the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .",,,
 We report here that Ox LDL enhanced DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to an NF-kappaB sequence following activation of CD36 - producing CHO cells with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .,producing;,23;,Gene_expression;
 This enhanced DNA binding activity was inhibited by coincubation of CD36 transfected cells with the human CD36 - specific antibody OKM5 .,,,
 We also determined that activation of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity required an intact carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic segment on CD36 .,,,
 Our results support the idea that human CD36 mediates signal transduction events in response to Ox LDL .,,,
 Transcriptional regulation during myelopoiesis .,,,
 The coordinated production of all blood cells from a common stem cell is a highly regulated process involving successive stages of commitment and differentiation .,,,
" From analyses of mice deficient in transcription factor genes and from the characterizations of chromosome breakpoints in human leukemias , it has become evident that transcription factors are important regulators of hematopoiesis .",,,
" During myelopoiesis , which includes the development of granulocytic and monocytic lineages , transcription factors from several families are active , including AML1 / CBF beta , C/EBP , Ets , c-Myb , HOX , and MZF-1 .",active;,20;,Positive_regulation;
 Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in myeloid cells ; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of myeloid-specific genes .,expressed;,6;,Gene_expression;

 Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors and the control of apoptosis .,,,
 The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate unwanted cells from a wide variety of organisms .,,,
" Various extracellular signals , often converging in common intracellular pathways , can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion .",,,
 Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors regulate apoptosis in many cell types .,,,
" In most cells , Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis ; however , under some circumstances , activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis .",,,
 The role of Rel/NF-kappa B proteins in viral oncogenesis and the regulation of viral transcription .,,,
" Rel/NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that consists of multiple polypeptide subunits , and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve protein-protein interactions , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , proteolytic degradation , and nucleocytoplasmic translocation .",,,
" The sophisticated control of Rel/NF-kappa B activity is not surprising since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion .",,,
" Thus , it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens , which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel/NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication , cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses .",,,
 This review will cover the molecular mechanisms that are utilized by mammalian oncogenic viruses to affect the activity of Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors and the role of Rel/NF-kappa B in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication .,,,
 Abnormal apoptosis and cell cycle progression in humans exposed to methyl tertiary-butyl ether and benzene contaminating water .,,,
" 1. In this study we hypothesized that in individuals with certain genetic makeup , MTBE , benzene or their metabolites act as adducts and may induce programmed cell death .",,,
 2 .,,,
" Our study involved a group of 60 male and female subjects who were exposed to MTBE and benzene-contaminated water concentrations up to 76 PPB for MTBE and 14 PPB for benzene , for a period of 5 to 8 years .",,,
" For comparison , we recruited a control group consisting of 32 healthy males and females with similar age distribution and without a history of exposure to MTBE or benzene .",,,
 3 .,,,
 Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) of both groups were tested for the percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle progression using flow cytometry .,,,
 4 .,,,
" When apoptotic lymphocytes from exposed individuals were compared to apoptotic lymphocytes from the control group , statistically-significant differences between each mean group were detected ( 26.4 +/- 1.8 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 , respectively ) , indicating an increased rate of apoptosis in 80.5 % of exposed individuals ( P < 0.0001 , Mann-Whitney U-Test ) .",,,
 MTBE and benzene-induced apoptosis is attributed to a discrete block within the cell cycle progression .,,,
" Because cell cycle analysis showed that in PBL from chemically-exposed individuals , between 20-50 % of cells were accumulated at the S-G2/M boundaries .",,,
 5 .,,,
 One of the signaling molecules which mediates programmed cell death is nuclear factor Kappa-B ( NF-kappa B ) .,,,
 NF-kappa B was examined as one of the many molecular mechanisms for mediating cell death by MTBE and benzene .,,,
" Indeed , addition of inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , to the lymphocytes of the chemically-exposed group was capable of inhibiting programmed cell death by 40 % .",,,
 This reversal of apoptosis almost to the control level by inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation may indicate involvement of this signaling molecule in MTBE and benzene induction of programmed cell death .,,,
 Activation of a novel gene in 3q21 and identification of intergenic fusion transcripts with ecotropic viral insertion site I in leukemia .,,,
" We have identified a novel gene , GR6 , located within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21 , that is normally expressed in early fetal development but not in adult peripheral blood .",expressed;,22;,Gene_expression;

" All fusions splice the 5' ends of the 3q21 genes into exon 2 of the EVI1 gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of MDS1 - EVI1 and to those previously documented in leukemias with t(3;21) and t(3;12) , in which acute myelogenous leukemia 1 - EVI1 fusions and ETV6 - EVI1 fusions , respectively , occur .",,,
 The Ribophorin I - EVI1 fusion in particular may be a common occurrence in t(3;3) .,,,
 Alcohol-induced regulation of nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta in human monocytes .,,,
" Acute ethanol exposure has the capacity to modulate immune functions , particularly , to down regulate monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines .",,,
" However , the intracellular mechanisms for these effects of ethanol are yet to be understood .",,,
" Considering that nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel is a common regulatory element of the promoter region of the inflammatory cytokine genes , herein , we tested the hypothesis that acute ethanol affects NF-kappa B activation in human monocytes .",,,
 Adherence-isolated monocytes showed constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B .,,,
" A clinically relevant dose ( 25 mM ) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased NF-kappa B binding activity in monocytes with a preferential induction of the inhibitory , p50 / p50 , NF-kappa B/Rel homodimer , and resulted in no induction of the p65 / p50 heterodimer .",induction;induction;,25;42;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" In contrast , lipopolysaccharide stimulation primarily induced the p65 / p50 heterodimer that has been shown to result in gene activation .",induced;,7;,Positive_regulation;

" Consequently , these results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol may affect production of inflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1 beta , and interleukin-6 by disrupting NF-kappa B signaling in monocytes .",affect;production;,13;14;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 Four P-like elements are required for optimal transcription of the mouse IL-4 gene : involvement of a distinct set of nuclear factor of activated T cells and activator protein-1 family proteins .,required;transcription;,5;8;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
 We previously identified the P sequence as a critical regulatory element of the human IL-4 promoter .,,,
" In the mouse IL-4 promoter , there are five elements homologous to the human P sequence designated conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLE0 ) , P , P2 , P3 and P4 .",,,
" To characterize the role of these P-like elements and their binding factors in the native promoter , we did transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .",,,
" Transfection of EL-4 cells with the IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs carrying mutated P-like elements showed that four P-like elements , CLE0 , P , P2 and P4 , but not P3 , were required for optimal activation of the IL-4 promoter .",activation;,36;,Positive_regulation;
" EMSA showed that both constitutive and inducible complexes bound to CLE0 , P , P2 and P4 , whereas only a constitutive complex bound to P3 .",,,
" In competition and antibody supershift assays in EMSA , complexes formed with P or P2 proved to contain nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family proteins as major components .",,,
" Activator protein ( AP ) -1 family proteins interacted with CLE0 , P , P2 and P4 .",,,
 NFAT/AP-1 complex formed only with P and P2 .,,,
 Cross-competition assays among the P-like elements revealed element-specific and common complexes .,,,
" Six tandem repeats of the P element linked to the SV40 promoter responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , while that of other elements did not .",,,
 It would thus appear that components of each P-like element-binding complexes are not identical and may coordinately contribute to transcriptional activity .,,,
 The ability of BHRF1 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on stimulus and cell type .,,,
 The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas - mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease .,,,
" To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2 , as an anti-apoptosis protein .",,,
 Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti - Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis .,Expression;,1;,Gene_expression;
" In addition , BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells .",,,
 The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL .,,,
" Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti - Fas - induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3 / CPP32 , but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors .",inhibited;activation;activation;,17;25;49;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti - Fas - induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .,,,
" Surprisingly , expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bcl-2 in a B-cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti - Fas - mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells .",expression;,3;,Gene_expression;
" Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .",,,
 NF-AT activation induced by a CAML - interacting member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily .,,,
 Activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor ( NF-AT ) is a key event underlying lymphocyte action .,,,
 The CAML ( calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand ) protein is a coinducer of NF-AT activation when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells .,overexpressed;,17;,Positive_regulation;
 A member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily was isolated by virtue of its affinity for CAML .,affinity;,16;,Binding;
" Cross-linking of this lymphocyte-specific protein , designated TACI ( transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor ) , on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells with TACI - specific antibodies led to activation of the transcription factors NF-AT , AP-1 , and NFkappaB .",,,
" TACI - induced activation of NF-AT was specifically blocked by a dominant-negative CAML mutant , thus implicating CAML as a signaling intermediate .",,,
 The DNA binding domain of the A-MYB transcription factor is responsible for its B cell-specific activity and binds to a B cell 110-kDa nuclear protein .,binds;,18;,Binding;
 Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the A-MYB transcription factor plays central and specific role in the regulation of mature B cell proliferation and/or differentiation .,,,
" Furthermore , it is highly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease .",expressed;,6;,Gene_expression;
" We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all the B cell lines studied , but not in T cells .",regulation;,12;,Regulation;

" Furthermore , the functional domains responsible for DNA binding , transactivation , and negative regulation , previously characterized in a fibroblast context , were found to have similar activity in B cells .",binding;,9;,Binding;
 The region of A-MYB responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the N-terminal 218 amino acids containing the DNA binding domain .,,,
" Finally , a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of all the B , but not T , cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain .",binds;,25;,Binding;
 We hypothesize that this 110-kDa protein may be a functionally important B cell-specific co-activator of A-MYB .,co-activator;,14;,Positive_regulation;
 Evidence that calcineurin is rate-limiting for primary human lymphocyte activation .,,,
 Cyclosporine ( CsA ) is both a clinical immunosuppressive drug and a probe to dissect intracellular signaling pathways .,,,
" In vitro , CsA inhibits lymphocyte gene activation by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin ( CN ) .",,,
" In clinical use , CsA treatment inhibits 50-75 % of CN activity in circulating leukocytes .",,,
 We modeled this degree of CN inhibition in primary human leukocytes in vitro in order to study the effect of partial CN inhibition on the downstream signaling events that lead to gene activation .,,,
" In CsA-treated leukocytes stimulated by calcium ionophore , the degree of reduction in CN activity was accompanied by a similar degree of inhibition of each event tested : dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins , nuclear DNA binding , activation of a transfected reporter gene construct , IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA accumulation , and IFN-gamma production .",inhibition;accumulation;production;,23;55;59;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Furthermore , the degree of CN inhibition was reflected by a similar degree of reduction in lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-gamma production in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures .",reduction;production;,15;21;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 These data support the conclusion that CN activity is rate-limiting for the activation of primary human T lymphocytes .,,,
" Thus , the reduction of CN activity observed in CsA-treated patients is accompanied by a similar degree of reduction in lymphocyte gene activation , and accounts for the immunosuppression observed .",,,
 Cooperation of binding sites for STAT6 and NF kappa B/rel in the IL-4 - induced up-regulation of the human IgE germline promoter .,Cooperation;up-regulation;,1;16;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 Ig heavy chain class switching is directed by cytokines inducing transcription from unrearranged CH genes .,,,
" Subsequently , such primed cells can undergo switch recombination to express the selected new isotype .",,,

 This study describes the characterization of two additional cis-acting elements that interact with members of the NF kappa B/rel transcription factor family in an IL-4 - independent fashion .,,,
 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that the nucleoprotein complex formed on the upstream site ( NF kappa B1 ) contains the classical p50 / p65 heterodimer .,,,

 Dual effects of LPS antibodies on cellular uptake of LPS and LPS-induced proinflammatory functions .,,,
" Human phagocytes recognize bacterial LPS ( endotoxin ) through membrane CD14 ( mCD14 ) , a proinflammatory LPS receptor .",,,
 This study tested the hypothesis that anti-LPS Abs neutralize endotoxin by blocking cellular uptake through mCD14 .,,,
 Ab-associated changes in the uptake and cellular distribution of FITC-LPS were assessed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy in human CD14 - transfected Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts ( CHO - CD14 cells ) and human peripheral blood monocytes .,,,
 LPS core- and O-side chain-specific mAbs inhibited mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake by both cell types in the presence of serum .,,,
 O-side chain-specific mAb concurrently enhanced complement-dependent LPS uptake by monocytes through complement receptor-1 ( CR1 ) and uptake by CHO - CD14 cells involving another heat-labile serum factor(s) and cell-associated recognition molecule(s) .,,,
" Core-specific mAb inhibited mCD14 - mediated uptake of homologous and heterologous LPS , while producing less concurrent enhancement of non - mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake .",,,
" The modulation by anti-LPS mAbs of mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake was associated with inhibition of LPS - induced nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) translocation and TNF-alpha secretion in CHO - CD14 cells and monocytes , respectively , while mAb enhancement of non - mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake stimulated these activities .",inhibition;induced;secretion;stimulated;,15;19;28;50;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Localization;Positive_regulation;

 Transcriptional up-regulation of the c-sis / platelet-derived growth factor-B ( PDGF-B ) proto-oncogene by the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .,,,

 Induction of endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules by tumor necrosis factor is blocked by protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors : role of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B .,,,
" Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) inhibitors can down-modulate the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -mediated activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B in ML-1a , a monocytic cell line ( Singh and Aggarwal , J. Biol. Chem. 1995 : 270 : 10631 ) .",,,
" Since TNF is one of the major inducers of various adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells and their expression is known to require the activation of NF-kappa B , we examined the effect of PTPase inhibitors on the TNF-mediated induction of intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 , vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) -1 .",effect;induction;,33;40;,Regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Like ML-1a , human dermal microvessel endothelial cells ( MVEC ) treated with TNF rapidly activated ( within 30 min ) NF-kappa B ; this effect was completely abolished by co-treatment with phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , a specific inhibitor of PTPase .",,,

 The spatial distribution of human immunoglobulin genes within the nucleus : evidence for gene topography independent of cell type and transcriptional activity .,,,
 The three-dimensional positioning of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes within the nucleus of human cells was investigated using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy .,,,
" The visualization of heavy and light chain genes in B-lymphoid cells showed that the three Ig genes are differentially and nonrandomly distributed in different nuclear subvolumes : the kappa genes were found to be preferentially confined to an outer nuclear volume , whereas the gamma and lambda genes consistently occupied more central positions within the nucleus , the lambda genes being more interior when compared with the gamma genes .",,,
 The data further show that these overall topographical distributions are independent of gene transcriptional activity and are conserved in different cell types .,,,
" Although subtle gene movements within those defined topographical regions can not be excluded by this study , the results indicate that tissue specificity of gene expression is not accompanied by drastic changes in gene nuclear topography , rather suggesting that gene organization within the nucleus may be primarily dependent on structural constraints imposed on the respective chromosomes .",,,

 Dithiocarbamates ( DTCs ) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation in a number of cell types .,,,
" Given the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response , NF-kappaB inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases .",,,

 Suppression of nuclear factor kappa B and CD18 - mediated leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium by dexamethasone .,,,
" PURPOSE : To demonstrate that leukocyte adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells is mediated by the CD18 antigen , and to determine whether dexamethasone directly suppresses adhesion by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) .",,,
 METHODS : Cultured bovine corneal endothelium was stimulated for 6 hours by 40 micron/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) .,,,
 Dexamethasone was added 1 hour before TNFalpha stimulation in the dexamethasone group .,,,
" After stimulation , neutrophils separated from a healthy human volunteer were added with or without anti - CD18 antibody .",,,
" The culture plate was settled for 15 minutes at 37 degrees C , and then neutrophils were activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine for 5 minutes .",,,
 Nonadherent neutrophils were removed by sealing and inverting the culture well .,,,
 The intracellular localization of NFkappaB after TNFalpha simulation was determined by confocal immunocytochemistry using an anti - p65 antibody .,,,
" RESULTS : Neutrophil adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells increased significantly on exposure to TNFalpha ( 451.4+/-45.4 cells/mm2 , n = 16 ) compared to control ( 156.7+/-27.3 cells/mm2 , n = 16 , P < 0.01 ) .",,,
" This increased adhesion was suppressed by the addition of anti - CD18 antibody ( 157.6+/-25.1 cells/mm2 , n = 8 , P < 0.01 ) and by pretreatment with 10(-7) M dexamethasone ( 207.9+/-31.5 cells/mm2 , n = 10 , P < 0.01 ) .",,,
" Immunocytochemistry 60 minutes after stimulation revealed that NFkappaB was located in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells ; however , the addition of TNFalpha caused NFkappaB to translocate into the nucleus .",,,
 Pretreatment with dexamethasone tapered NFkappaB translocation into the nucleus .,,,
 CONCLUSIONS : Leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium was shown to be mediated by CD18 expressed on activated leukocytes .,expressed;,16;,Gene_expression;
 Pretreatment of the endothelium with dexamethasone inhibited leukocyte adhesion ; this may be due in part to the suppression of NFkappaB entry into the nucleus .,,,

" The active ingredients mediating the pharmacological effect are mainly sesquiterpene lactones , such as helenalin , 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin , chamissonolid and their ester derivatives .",,,
" While these compounds affect various cellular processes , current data do not fully explain how sesquiterpene lactones exert their anti-inflammatory effect .",,,
" We show here that helenalin , and , to a much lesser degree , 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin and chamissonolid , inhibit activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB .",,,
" This difference in efficacy , which correlates with the compounds ' anti-inflammatory potency in vivo , may be explained by differences in structure and conformation .",,,
" NF-kappaB , which resides in an inactive , cytoplasmic complex in unstimulated cells , is activated by phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory subunit , IkappaB .",,,
" Helenalin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in response to four different stimuli in T-cells , B-cells and epithelial cells and abrogates kappaB-driven gene expression .",,,
" This inhibition is selective , as the activity of four other transcription factors , Oct-1 , TBP , Sp1 and STAT 5 was not affected .",affected;,25;,Regulation;
 We show that inhibition is not due to a direct modification of the active NF-kappaB heterodimer .,,,
" Rather , helenalin modifies the NF-kappaB/IkappaB complex , preventing the release of IkappaB .",,,

 mNFATc complexed with AP-1 bound specifically to the murine IL-2 NFAT recognition sequence and activated transcription from the co-transfected IL-2 promoter in COS-7 cells .,complexed;bound;activated;transcription;,2;5;15;16;,Binding;Binding;Positive_regulation;Transcription;

" In the mouse embryo , mNFATc transcript was strongly expressed in thymus , lung and submandibular gland and weakly in skeletal muscle and heart suggesting that mNFATc may have a role both in embryogenesis and in mature T cells .",expressed;,10;,Transcription;
 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase couples the interleukin-2 receptor to the cell cycle regulator E2F .,,,
 Cell cycle progression initiated by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) in T cells is critical for lymphoproliferation and an immune response .,,,
 Phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) is activated by IL-2 .,,,
" However , nuclear targets for PI3K are not known .",,,
 Here we identify the cell cycle regulator E2F as an IL-2 target in T lymphocytes and PI3K as the critical signaling pathway .,,,
 We eliminate both Stat5 and Raf/MEK pathways from E2F regulation .,,,
 Protein kinase B ( PKB ) is activated by IL-2 via PI3K .,activated;,8;,Positive_regulation;

" Inhibition of PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of Rb , induction of cyclin D3 , and degradation of p27kip1 .",inhibits;phosphorylation;degradation;,4;5;15;,Negative_regulation;Phosphorylation;Protein_catabolism;
 These results establish a crucial PI3K / PKB - mediated link between the IL-2 teceptor and the cell cycle machinery .,,,
 Thiol modulation inhibits the interleukin ( IL ) -1-mediated activation of an IL-1 receptor - associated protein kinase and NF-kappa B .,,,
 The interleukin-1 receptor type I ( IL-1RI ) is associated with other proteins thus forming a complex system by which IL-1 exerts its various signals .,associated;,10;,Binding;
" The initiating event is still uncertain , but activation of a recently described receptor-associated protein kinase is one of the earliest events detectable ( Martin et al. , Eur.J.Immunol.1994.24 : 1566 ) .",,,
 IL-1 signaling is commonly accompanied by oxidative processes and is thought to be subject to redox regulation .,,,
 We therefore investigated whether the activation of the IL-1RI - associated protein kinase could be a target for redox regulation and whether an altered activity of the kinase could influence IL-1-mediated NF-kappa B activation .,,,
" A murine T cell line , EL4 , was stimulated with IL-1 with and without pretreatment with different compounds known to influence the cellular redox status .",,,
" Thiol modifying agents like diamide , menadione , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , diethyl dithiocarbamate or phenylarsine oxide inhibited the IL-1-induced activation of the IL-1RI - associated protein kinase .",,,
" N-Acetylcysteine , alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl , aminotriazole or nitrofurantoin did not show any effect .",,,
 The inhibition by PDTC was reversible unless glutathione synthesis was blocked by buthionine sulfoximine .,,,
 The described conditions which inhibited or prevented the activation of the IL-1RI - associated kinase similarly impaired the activation of NF-kappa B in EL4 cells .,,,
 From these observations we conclude that free thiols in the IL-1RI complex are essential for the activation of the IL-1RI - associated protein kinase and that this process is mandatory for IL-1 signaling leading to NF-kappa B activation .,,,
 ATF1 and CREB trans-activate a cell cycle regulated histone H4 gene at a distal nuclear matrix associated promoter element .,trans-activate;regulated;,4;8;,Positive_regulation;Regulation;
 Proteins of the ATF/CREB class of transcription factors stimulate gene expression of several cell growth-related genes through protein kinase A-related cAMP response elements .,,,

" One ATF/CRE motif is located in the distal promoter at the nuclear matrix-associated Site IV , and the second motif is present in the proximal promoter at Site I .",,,
" Both ATF/CRE motifs overlap binding sequences for the multifunctional YY1 transcription factor , which has previously been shown to be nuclear matrix associated .",,,
" Subnuclear fractionation reveals that there are two ATF1 isoforms which appear to differ with respect to DNA binding activity and partition selectively between nuclear matrix and nonmatrix compartments , consistent with the role of the nuclear matrix in regulating gene expression .",binding;,18;,Binding;

 IL-2 and IL-7 induce heterodimerization of STAT5 isoforms in human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts .,,,
" Despite differences in T cell responses induced by interleukin ( IL ) -2 and IL-7 , both cytokines modulate T cell functions by activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins .",,,
" We examined the contribution of the two isoforms of STAT5 , STAT5A and STAT5B , to IL-2 - and IL-7 - induced activation of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts .",,,
" Both cytokines induced assembly of STAT5A and STAT5B containing complexes capable of binding to the interferon-gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) , and these complexes rapidly translocated ( within 1 min ) into the nucleus of IL-2 - or I L-7 - treated cells .",induced;complexes;binding;complexes;translocated;treated;,3;10;13;25;27;43;,Positive_regulation;Binding;Binding;Binding;Localization;Positive_regulation;
 The kinetics of this translocation were delayed in IL-7 - treated as compared to IL-2 - treated cells .,,,

 These data suggest that IL-2 and IL-7 induce assembly of STAT heterodimers in a similar manner and that subsequent cellular responses may be driven by induction of similar sets of genes .,,,
 Molecular mechanisms of anoxia/reoxygenation-induced neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cells .,,,
 The objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and ( 2 ) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early ( minutes ) and late ( hours ) hyperadhesivity of postanoxic HUVECs to human neutrophils .,,,
" The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs , with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) after reoxygenation .",,,
" Oxypurinol and catalase inhibited phase-1 adhesion , suggesting a role for xanthine oxidase and H2O2 .",,,
" In comparison , platelet activating factor ( PAF ) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion .",,,
" Anti - intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and anti - P-selectin antibodies ( monoclonal antibodies [ mAbs ] ) attenuated phase-1 neutrophil adhesion , consistent with roles for constitutively expressed ICAM-1 and enhanced surface expression of preformed P-selectin .",roles;expressed;enhanced;expression;,28;31;34;36;,Regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Phase-2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an anti - E-selectin mAb , indicating a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response .",,,
" Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides containing the nuclear factor-kappa B or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated phase-2 response , suggesting a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis .",,,
" Surface expression of ICAM-1 , P-selectin , and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase-1 and -2 neutrophil adhesion responses .",expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
" Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R elicits a two-phase neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules .",,,

" To further clarify the complex transcriptional regulation of the human GM-CSF gene , which was extensively investigated in activated T cells , we have studied the role of an upstream NF-kappaB like site in the 5637 non-lymphoid cell line , which derives from a bladder carcinoma and constitutively produces GM-CSF .",produces;,49;,Gene_expression;

 Cyclosporin A inhibits monocyte tissue factor activation in cardiac transplant recipients .,inhibits;activation;,3;7;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 BACKGROUND : Fibrin deposition and thrombosis have been implicated in both allograft rejection and vasculopathy after cardiac transplantation .,,,
" Because monocytes play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of intravascular coagulation activation through their ability to synthesize tissue factor ( TF ) , we asked ( 1 ) whether monocyte TF activation occurs in cardiac transplant recipients and ( 2 ) whether monocyte TF expression is affected by treatment with cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .",activation;synthesize;activation;occurs;expression;affected;,13;18;33;34;46;48;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Regulation;
 METHODS AND RESULTS : We measured levels of TF activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and highly purified monocytes/macrophages from 10 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients and 10 healthy control subjects .,,,
 TF activity generated by both unstimulated and endotoxin-stimulated cells was significantly higher in transplant recipients than in control subjects ( P < .05 ) .,generated;,3;,Positive_regulation;

 Agonistic activity of a CD40 - specific single-chain Fv constructed from the variable regions of mAb G28-5 .,,,
 A single-chain Fv ( sFv ) was expressed from the variable regions of the CD40 - specific mAb G28-5 .,,,
 The molecule bound CD40 with a high affinity ( 2.2 nM ) and was a monomer in solution .,bound;,3;,Binding;
" Surprisingly , G28-5 sFv was a potent CD40 agonist that rapidly crosslinked CD40 on the cell surface but did not crosslink CD40 - Ig in solution .",crosslinked;crosslink;,12;21;,Binding;Binding;
 G28-5 sFv was a more potent agonist than G28-5 IgG and was able to stimulate CD40 responses by B cells and monocytes .,,,
" G28-5 IgG partially blocked , whereas G28-5 sFv augmented CD40 responses during stimulation with natural ligand ( gp39 - CD8 fusion protein ) .",,,
 These results indicate that the functional activity of ligands built from the binding site of G28-5 is highly dependent upon the size and physical properties of the molecule both in solution and on the cell surfaces .,,,
 Competent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in cell-free extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum groups B and D in an optimized RNA transcription assay .,,,
" The human autosomal recessive disease , xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) , can result from mutations in any one of seven genes , designated XPA through XPG .",,,
" Of these , the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor , TFIIH , involved in both nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and initiation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II .",,,
" In humans , mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER , resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation .",,,
" However , no transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D .",,,
 We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D .,,,
" Although the growth rate was normal , the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH .",,,
 Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar transcription activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells .,,,
" Thus , we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do not have impaired RNA transcription activity .",,,
" We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients , and discuss a ' conditional phenotype ' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions .",,,
 Cyclosporin A inhibits early mRNA expression of G0/G1 switch gene 2 ( G0S2 ) in cultured human blood mononuclear cells .,inhibits;,3;,Negative_regulation;
 Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) may achieve its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin which is required for activation of target genes by members of the NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) transcription factor family .,,,
" Among these target genes is the gene encoding interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) , a cytokine facilitating progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle .",,,
" However , IL2 does not reverse CsA inhibition , suggesting that at least one other NFAT-sensitive gene may be involved .",,,
" The human G0/G1 switch gene , G0S2 , has potential NFAT-binding sites in the 5' flank and encodes a small basic potential phosphoprotein of unknown function .",,,
" Using a sensitive , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay , G0S2 mRNA levels were assayed in cultured blood mononuclear cells .",levels;,16;,Transcription;

 Both these responses are inhibited by CsA .,inhibited;,5;,Negative_regulation;

 Estrogen receptor diminishes DNA - binding activities of chicken GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins .,diminishes;,3;,Negative_regulation;

" Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate , human ER reduced the binding activities of chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins to GATA and CACCC sites in the H5 promoter and enhancer .",,,
" In contrast , the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were not affected by ER .",,,
 Binding of ER to an estrogen response element was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate .,Binding;enhanced;,1;10;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
 This lysate was also necessary for ER to diminish the DNA - binding activity of GATA-1 .,necessary;,5;,Positive_regulation;
 These results suggest that additional factor(s) are necessary for full ER function .,necessary;,8;,Positive_regulation;
 Both GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins are critical for the developmentally regulated expression of erythroid-specific genes .,,,
 We hypothesize that interference in DNA - binding activities of GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins is the mechanism by which the ER inhibits regulation of these genes .,interference;,4;,Negative_regulation;

 Fetal and neonatal lymphocytes are relatively resistant to activation and cytokine production when stimulated either via their T-cell antigen receptors or lectins .,,,
 The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon have not been clearly elucidated .,,,
 We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal/neonatal T-cell activation may be due to lack of expression of the transcriptional regulatory elements required for T-cell activation .,,,
" We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine both fetal and term neonatal cord bloods for mRNA expression of three transcription factors implicated in T-cell activation : c-jun , c-fos , and NF kappa B ( p50 subunit ) .",,,
 We demonstrate that mRNAs for all three of these regulatory factors are expressed in fetal blood cells by the 27th week of gestation and in term cord bloods .,expressed;,13;,Transcription;
 Activation of term infant cord blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in up-regulation of both c-jun and c-fos mRNAs within 15 min of stimulation .,,,
" However , secretion of IL-2 by anti-CD3-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells was still blunted compared with control cells from adults .",secretion;blunted;,3;14;,Localization;Positive_regulation;
 We conclude that fetal nucleated blood cells constitutively express important genes for cytokine regulation and are able to increase intracellular accumulation of the mRNAs for these factors in response to anti-CD3 stimulation .,increase;accumulation;,19;21;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Thus , qualitative differences in the capacity to regulate these factors could not be shown in fetal blood cells .",regulate;,9;,Regulation;

 Replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in primary human T cells is dependent on the autocrine secretion of tumor necrosis factor through the control of nuclear factor-kappa B activation .,,,
 Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha controls T-cell activation and is a major inducer of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 replication in chronically infected cells .,,,
" Therefore , we have investigated its role in primary cultures of HIV-infected human T lymphocytes by using neutralizing anti - TNF-alpha antibodies or TNF-alpha .",,,
 Primary resting T lymphocytes produced TNF-alpha and supported HIV replication after T-cell receptor activation .,produced;,5;,Gene_expression;

" Anti - TNF-alpha also prevented nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation , and a good correlation between this inhibition and inhibition of HIV replication was observed .",,,

" Moreover , anti - TNF-alpha inhibited HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -driven transcription of a reporter gene in primary T cells in response to activation , either in the presence or the absence of HIV-1 Tat .",,,
 Our results support an important role for autocrine TNF-alpha secretion in controlling HIV replication in primary T cells because of its ability to maintain NF-kappa B elevated in the nucleus of T cells .,secretion;,10;,Localization;
 A thiol antioxidant regulates IgE isotype switching by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor-kappaB .,,,
" The binding site for nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is present at the promoter region of the germline Cepsilon gene , but there is little information on whether this factor is involved in regulating IgE synthesis by human B cells .",,,
" Accordingly , we studied the role of NF-kappaB in germline Cepsilon transcription by using two human Burkitt 's lymphoma B cell lines , DND39 and DG75 .",,,
" In both cell lines , n-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent thiol antioxidant , inhibited the triggering of the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB by IL-4 and by anti - CD40 monoclonal antibody .",,,
" Although IL-4 activated signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 6 in addition to NF-kappaB , NAC treatment or the transfection of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides for NF-kappaB or STAT6 only partly blocked IL-4 - induced germline Cepsilon transcription .",activated;,3;,Positive_regulation;
" However , these two decoy oligodeoxynucleotides together almost completely abrogated IL-4 - induced germline Cepsilon transcription .",,,
" Of note , CD40 - mediated enhancement of IL-4 - driven germline Cepsilon transcription was markedly decreased by NAC or by a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide for NF-kappaB .",,,
 The effect of NAC was also examined on deletional switch recombination underlying the isotype switch to IgE .,,,
 NAC inhibited the generation of Smu/Sepsilon switch fragments in normal human B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti - CD40 monoclonal antibody .,,,
 It also abolished IL-4 - induced upregulation of CD40 but promoted upregulation of CD23 .,abolished;upregulation;promoted;upregulation;,3;7;11;12;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Regulation of NF-kappa B activity by I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta stability .,stability;,16;,Protein_catabolism;
 Transcription factor NF-kappa B must be released from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules ( I kappa Bs ) in order to move to the nucleus and to activate its target genes .,,,
 Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B in some cell-types and of sustained nuclear NF-kappa B activity after stimulation .,,,
 Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive NF-kappa B activity in mature B cells .,,,
 We therefore compared the turnover of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in mature B cells and HeLa cells .,,,
 Both proteins display a high turnover in B cells although I kappa B beta is considerably more stable than I kappa B alpha .,,,
 The half-life of both inhibitors is increased in HeLa cells .,increased;,7;,Positive_regulation;
" In contrast , all other NF-kappa B/I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell-types .",,,
 The elevated turnover of endogenous I kappa B alpha in Namalwa cells is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in non-B cells .,,,
" Furthermore , we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of NF-kappa B .",,,

 Control of NF-kappa B activity by the I kappa B beta inhibitor .,,,
 The transcription factor NF-kappa B is maintained in an inactive cytoplasmic state by I kappa B inhibitors .,,,

" In addition , we have isolated a third NF-kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B epsilon ( 1 ) .",,,
" Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta are proteolytically degraded , resulting in NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus .",,,
 Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published .,associated;degraded;,21;31;,Binding;Protein_catabolism;

 We now report on the transcription factors which bind and transactivate this enhancer sequence .,,,

" In addition , both RelA and c-Rel , but not NF-kappa B1 , were shown to transactivate an ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct .",,,
 In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site .,,,
" Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility supershift assay , one of these complexes was shown to contain NF-kappa B1 and RelA , and to bind with higher affinity to the consensus kappa B site in the HIV long terminal repeat .",,,

 Expression of transcription factor genes after influenza A virus infection .,,,
 Infection of human monocytes with influenza A virus induces a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines and mononuclear cell attracting chemokines before the infected cells undergo apoptosis .,,,
 The underlying mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are transcriptionally initiated after virus infection are still poorly understood .,,,
" Activation of NF-kappa B seems to play an important role in the regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes , but can not be the only mechanism , since several cytokine genes lack respective binding sites in their promoter regions .",,,
" Therefore , we additionally investigated other transcription factors of possible importance such as CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , and OTF-2 .",importance;,11;,Regulation;
" To explore long-term regulatory mechanisms , we investigated the induction of transcription factors on the gene expression level which may be important to substitute for metabolized transcription factor proteins after their activation .",,,
" We identified a cell-type-specific differential response : CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , OFT-2 , and NF-kappa B genes were strongly induced 1 to 4 hours after influenza A virus infection in the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 , while in freshly prepared human monocytes no significant changes were detected .",induced;changes;,22;49;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;

" Oxidants , transcription factors , and intestinal inflammation .",,,
 It is now well appreciated that chronic gut inflammation is characterized by enhanced production of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen .,,,

 Supershift experiments revealed that JunD and c-Fos proteins mediated anti - CD19 induced AP-1-binding activity in 1E8 cells .,,,
" In contrast , CD19 cross-linking in BLIN-1 cells resulted in the induction of NF-kappaB , but had no apparent effect on AP-1-binding activity .",cross-linking;,5;,Binding;

 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies differ in basal transcription and nuclear factor recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes .,,,
" The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV-1 replication , including expression of the proviral genome .",,,
" To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood .",,,
 Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI LTR ) within the 455-bp U3 region .,,,
 Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4 - positive lymphocyte cell line ) .,,,
" While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI LTR .",,,
" Differences in LTR sequence also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to cis-acting sites within the U3 region of the LTR , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .",,,
" In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding ( ATF/CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1 LTR .",,,
" These findings suggest that LTR sequence changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and transcription factor recruitment , which may , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin .",,,
 Inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB activation attenuates apoptosis resistance in lymphoid cells .,,,
 Death-inducing ligands ( DILs ) such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been shown to activate a nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) -dependent program that may rescue cells from apoptosis induction .,,,
" We demonstrate here that TRAIL ( TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ) , a recently identified DIL , also activates NFkappaB in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to TNFalpha .",,,
" NFkappaB activity is independent from FADD , caspases , and apoptosis induction .",,,
" To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL , CD95 , TNFalpha , or doxorubicin , NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha .",overexpression;,32;,Gene_expression;
 Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines .,,,
" Moreover , both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin , antagonization of NFkappaB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity .",,,
 These data suggest that inhibition of NFkappaB activation may provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment .,,,
 The human toll signaling pathway : divergence of nuclear factor kappaB and JNK/SAPK activation upstream of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) .,,,
" The human homologue of Drosophila Toll ( hToll ) is a recently cloned receptor of the interleukin 1 receptor ( IL-1R ) superfamily , and has been implicated in the activation of adaptive immunity .",,,

" Surprisingly , however , removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on OCA-B / Oct-1 - dependent transcription .",removal;,5;,Negative_regulation;

 Limited proteolysis for assaying ligand binding affinities of nuclear receptors .,,,
 The binding of natural or synthetic ligands to nuclear receptors is the triggering event leading to gene transcription activation or repression .,,,
 Ligand binding to the ligand binding domain of these receptors induces conformational changes that are evidenced by an increased resistance of this domain to proteases .,,,
 In vitro labeled receptors were incubated with various synthetic or natural agonists or antagonists and submitted to trypsin digestion .,,,
 Proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified .,,,
" The amount of trypsin-resistant fragments was proportional to receptor occupancy by the ligand , and allowed the determination of dissociation constants ( kDa ) .",,,
" Using the wild-type or mutated human retinoic acid receptor alpha as a model , kDa values determined by classical competition binding assays using tritiated ligands are in agreement with those measured by the proteolytic assay .",,,
" This method was successfully extended to human retinoic X receptor alpha , glucocorticoid receptor , and progesterone receptor , thus providing a basis for a new , faster assay to determine simultaneously the affinity and conformation of receptors when bound to a given ligand .",,,
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan can induce NF-kappaB-dependent activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells .,,,
" Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) .",,,
 The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system .,,,
 These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4 - expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals .,expressing;,11;,Gene_expression;
" Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .",,,
" The implication of protein tyrosine kinase(s) , protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 .",,,
" It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .",,,
" M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild-type , but not the kappaB-mutated , HIV-1 LTR region .",,,
" Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous TNF-alpha .",,,
 The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in T cells and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection .,,,
 Oxidative stress suppresses transcription factor activities in stimulated lymphocytes .,,,
" Effects of oxidative stress on stimulation-dependent signal transduction , leading to IL-2 expression , were studied .",leading;expression;,10;13;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Purified quiescent human blood T lymphocytes were subjected to : ( i ) acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; ( ii ) chronic exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; and ( iii ) acute exposure to ionizing radiation .,,,
 The cells were then stimulated for 6 h .,,,
" DNA-binding activities ( determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) of three transcription factors : NFkappaB , AP-1 and NFAT , were abolished in the lymphocytes by all three modes of oxidative stress .",,,
 The lymphocytes exhibited lipid peroxidation only upon exposure to the lowest level of hydrogen peroxide used ( 20 microM ) .,,,
 All three modes of oxidative stress induced catalase activity in the lymphocytes .,,,
" The only exception was hydrogen peroxide at 20 microM , which did not induce catalase activity .",,,
" We conclude that : ( i ) suppression of specific transcription factor functions can potentially serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on human lymphocytes ; ( ii ) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in human lymphocytes upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does not induce catalase activity ; ( iii ) therefore , transcription factor DNA-binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation .",,,

 Redox signals and NF-kappaB activation in T cells .,,,
 Accumulating data from a number of laboratories have recently indicated that the response of transcription factor NF-kappaB to alterations in the redox homeostasis of cells may play an important role in modulating immune function .,,,
" The activation of NF-kappaB has been recognized to regulate a number of genes necessary for normal T cell responses including IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and several T cell surface receptors .",regulate;,9;,Regulation;
" Diminished NF-kappaB activity has been shown to occur in T cells with aging , suggesting that impaired activation of NF-kappaB might occur during cellular senescence .",,,
" In addition , aberrancies in NF-kappaB activity have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of diseases involving immune or inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis and HIV-1 infection .",,,
 The role of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as an integratory secondary messenger for divergent T cell signals has been complicated by the fact that various T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells differ markedly in the levels of NF-kappaB activation induced by oxidant stress .,,,
" Additionally , proposed pathways of NF-kappaB activation have been based on indirect evidence provided by experiments which used antioxidants to inhibit active NF-kappaB formation .",,,
" Further , complete activation of T cells requires at least two signals , one that stimulates an increase in intracellular calcium and one that stimulates enzymatic processes including kinases .",,,
" Similarly , substantial evidence indicates that full activation of NF-kappaB requires dual signals .",,,
 The ability of H2O2 or other ROS to induce T cell signals and functional responses by these two mechanisms is reviewed and the specific response of NF-kappaB to redox changes in T cells is examined .,,,
 Data are also presented to suggest that the redox regulation in NF-kappaB activation may be relevant to immune-related diseases and to aging .,,,

 Ex vivo activation of tumor-draining lymph node T cells reverses defects in signal transduction molecules .,,,
 The adoptive transfer of tumor-draining lymph node ( LN ) T cells activated ex vivo with anti-CD3 and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) mediates the regression of the poorly immunogenic murine melanoma D5 .,,,
 The efficacy of the activated LN cells is augmented when the sensitizing tumor is a genetically modified variant ( designated D5G6 ) that secretes granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor .,secretes;,24;,Localization;
" In contrast to anti-CD3 / IL-2 - activated LN cells , adoptive transfer of freshly isolated tumor-draining LN T cells has no therapeutic activity .",,,

 Targeted disruption of the MyD88 gene results in loss of IL-1- and IL-18 - mediated function .,,,

 Mice generated by gene targeting to lack MyD88 have defects in T cell proliferation as well as induction of acute phase proteins and cytokines in response to IL-1 .,,,
 Increases in interferon-gamma production and natural killer cell activity in response to IL-18 are abrogated .,,,
 In vivo Th1 response is also impaired .,,,
" Furthermore , IL-18 - induced activation of NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) is blocked in MyD88 -/- Th1-developing cells .",,,
" Taken together , these results demonstrate that MyD88 is a critical component in the signaling cascade that is mediated by IL-1 receptor as well as IL-18 receptor .",,,

 Dimethyldithiocarbamate inhibits in vitro activation of primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes .,,,
" Dithiocarbamates ( DTC ) , a diverse group of industrial and therapeutic chemicals , have been reported to inhibit , enhance or have no effect on the immune system .",,,

" We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated Rho ( V14Rho ) has little or no effect on NFAT , Oct-1 , and NF-kappaB enhancer element activities under similar conditions .",effect;,42;,Regulation;

 A CD28 - associated signaling pathway leading to cytokine gene transcription and T cell proliferation without TCR engagement .,,,
 Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28 - specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis without further requirement for TCR coengagement .,,,
 This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 ( costimulatory signal ) alone without signal 1 ( TCR signal ) can activate T cells .,,,
" To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3 .",mediated;,10;,Positive_regulation;
" Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ , but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1 .",,,

" Low concentrations of RA inhibiting IgE synthesis ( 10(-10) mol/L ) affected neither B-cell proliferation nor the production of IgA , IgG , and IgM .",,,

 Nuclear factor-kappaB induction in CD45RO + and CD45RA + T cell subsets during aging .,,,
 An increase in the ratio of memory to naive T cells has been postulated to underlie immune hyporesponsiveness accompanying aging .,,,
" Our analyses of the induction of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) in activated memory ( CD45RO + ) and naive ( CD45RA + ) T cell subsets from young and elderly donors has demonstrated that , regardless of donor age , memory T cells are not significantly altered in their responsiveness to TNF-alpha - mediated induction of NFkappaB .",,,
" Although treatment with TNF-alpha induced nuclear localization of NFkappaB in both memory and naive T cell subsets , irrespective of the age of the donor , the levels of induced NFkappaB were significantly lower in both subsets of T cells obtained from the elderly , when compared to those in young .",,,

 Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and regulation of NF-kappaB activity in human leukemic T cells .,,,
 Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was investigated in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 and resistant ICR27TK.3 human leukemic T cells .,,,
" Following glucocorticoid treatment of 6TG1.1 cells , chromatin fragmentation was observed after a delay of 24 h .",,,
 Fragmentation was not observed in ICR27TK.3 cells containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors ( L753F ) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress AP-1 activity .,,,
" Nor was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486 , indicating that repression of AP-1 activity is not involved .",,,
" As described in other systems , fragmentation required ongoing protein synthesis .",,,
" However , inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide anytime during the first 18 h of steroid treatment was as effective in blocking chromatin fragmentation as inhibition for the entire period , suggesting that synthesis of a component with a rapid turnover rate is required .",,,
 Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of immunoreactive IkappaB alpha in sensitive 6TG1.1 cells but not in resistant ICR27TK.3 cells .,increase;,18;,Positive_regulation;

 The role of platelets for monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) secretion and surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) on endothelial cells has been assessed .,role;secretion;expression;,2;12;15;,Regulation;Localization;Gene_expression;
" METHODS AND RESULTS : Monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with nonstimulated or ADP-activated platelets for 6 hours , and secretion of MCP-1 and surface expression of ICAM-1 were determined by ELISA and flow cytometry , respectively .",secretion;expression;,24;29;,Localization;Localization;
" In the presence of ADP-activated platelets , both MCP-1 secretion and ICAM-1 surface expression were significantly increased compared with nonstimulated platelets ( P < 0.02 ) .",secretion;expression;increased;,10;14;17;,Localization;Localization;Positive_regulation;
 Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity was enhanced in the presence of activated platelets .,,,
" In addition , ADP-activated platelets induced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 promoter-dependent transcription .",,,
" Liposomal transfection of a double-stranded kappaB phosphorothioate oligonucleotide , but not of the mutated form , inhibited MCP-1 secretion and surface expression of ICAM-1 on activated endothelium ( P < 0.05 ) .",inhibited;secretion;expression;,17;19;22;,Negative_regulation;Localization;Localization;
 CONCLUSIONS : The present study indicates that activated platelets modulate chemotactic ( MCP-1 ) and adhesive ( ICAM-1 ) properties of endothelial cells via an NF-kappaB - dependent mechanism .,modulate;dependent;,10;28;,Positive_regulation;Regulation;

 Altered DNA - binding specificity mutants of EKLF and Sp1 show that EKLF is an activator of the beta-globin locus control region in vivo .,,,
 The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I hypersensitive sites ( 5'HS1-5 ) required for locus activation .,required;activation;,18;21;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
 5'HS3 contains six G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity .,essential;,8;,Positive_regulation;
" Members of a protein family , characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in transcription factor Sp1 , interact with these motifs .",interact;,22;,Binding;
" Because point mutagenesis can not distinguish between family members , it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3 .",,,
 We show that the function of such closely related proteins can be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF .,,,
 Testing their activity in transgenic mice shows that EKLF is a direct activator of 5'HS3 .,,,
" Activation of distinct transcription factors in neutrophils by bacterial LPS , interferon-gamma , and GM-CSF and the necessity to overcome the action of endogenous proteases .",Activation;,1;,Positive_regulation;
" Human neutrophils can be induced to actively transcribe a number of early-response genes , in particular those encoding cytokines , chemokines , and the high-affinity surface receptor for IgG , FcgammaRI .",induced;transcribe;,5;8;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;
" Although little is known to date about the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , several indications point to a role for distinct transcription factors , such as members of the NF-kappaB and STAT families .",,,
" In this study , we investigated whether these transcription factors become activated under stimulatory conditions which are known to induce gene transcription in neutrophils .",,,
" Unexpectedly , we found that conventional procedures employed to prepare cellular extracts cause the release of proteolytic activities that are normally stored in intracellular granules , resulting in the degradation of various NF-kappaB/Rel and STAT proteins .",,,
" To circumvent this problem , we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils , LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA - binding activity which essentially consists of p50 / RelA dimers , and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter .",binding;promotes;binding;,28;42;44;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Binding;
" Moreover , we report that neutrophil stimulation with GM-CSF results in the formation of a STAT5-containing DNA-binding activity .",,,
" Collectively , the current findings open new perspectives about mechanisms that are likely to regulate gene transcription in neutrophils .",,,
" In addition , the procedure described herein could prove useful in other cell types that express high levels of endogenous proteases .",,,
 Transcription factor activation in lymphokine activated killer cells and lymphocytes from patients receiving IL-2 immunotherapy .,,,
 Administration of the cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) can result in therapeutic benefits for individuals with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma .,,,
" Here we report an analysis of the transcription factor families AP-1 , Sp1 , NF-kappaB , and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) in cancer patients ' lymphocytes before and after IL-2 immunotherapy , as assessed by a gel-shift assay .",,,
" An in vitro surrogate of IL-2 immunotherapy is the incubation of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from healthy individuals in IL-2 for several days , resulting in the production of lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) activity in these cultures .",,,
" One purpose of this study was to describe the profile of transcription factor activation in these different populations , and assess whether the patterns observed correlated with functional differences in these cells .",,,
" Prior to in vivo IL-2 administration , the typical binding pattern of transcription factors in PBMC from patients resembled that seen in fresh PBMC from healthy individuals .",,,
" Over a 3-week course of IL-2 therapy , in most patients the binding patterns of AP-1 , Sp1 , and NF-kappaB proteins changed to resemble those seen in PBMC activated by IL-2 in vitro .",binding;changed;,13;23;,Binding;Positive_regulation;
" However , the cells obtained from IL-2 - treated patients did not have low-level constitutive expression of STAT binding factors as did LAK cells .",,,
" When these patient cells were further stimulated by IL-2 in vitro , additional differences in STAT induction patterns were noted .",,,
" These data provide further information on the molecular events occurring in immune cells generated through in vivo and in vitro administration of IL-2 , and further document that there is not a precise congruence between PBMC activated in vivo and in vitro by IL-2 .",,,
" A critical role of the p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( p75TNF-R ) in organ inflammation independent of TNF , lymphotoxin alpha , or the p55TNF-R .",,,
" Despite overwhelming evidence that enhanced production of the p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( p75TNF-R ) accompanies development of specific human inflammatory pathologies such as multi-organ failure during sepsis , inflammatory liver disease , pancreatitis , respiratory distress syndrome , or AIDS , the function of this receptor remains poorly defined in vivo .",enhanced;production;,5;6;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" We show here that at levels relevant to human disease , production of the human p75TNF-R in transgenic mice results in a severe inflammatory syndrome involving mainly the pancreas , liver , kidney , and lung , and characterized by constitutively increased NF-kappaB activity in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell compartment .",production;,12;,Gene_expression;
" This process is shown to evolve independently of the presence of TNF , lymphotoxin alpha , or the p55TNF-R , although coexpression of a human TNF transgene accelerated pathology .",,,
 These results establish an independent role for enhanced p75TNF-R production in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease and implicate the direct involvement of this receptor in a wide range of human inflammatory pathologies .,enhanced;production;,8;10;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;
" Potent inhibition of HIV type 1 replication by an antiinflammatory alkaloid , cepharanthine , in chronically infected monocytic cells .",,,
" Cepharanthine is a biscoclaurine alkaloid isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata and has been shown to have antiinflammatory , antiallergic , and immunomodulatory activities in vivo .",,,
" As several inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stresses are involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection , we investigated the inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) - and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced HIV-1 replication in chronically infected cell lines .",,,
" Two chronically HIV-1-infected cell lines , U1 ( monocytic ) and ACH-2 ( T lymphocytic ) , were stimulated with TNF-alpha or PMA and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of the compound .",,,
 HIV-1 replication was determined by p24 antigen level .,,,
 The inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -driven gene expression and nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activation were also examined .,,,
 Cepharanthine dose dependently inhibited HIV-1 replication in TNF-alpha - and PMA-stimulated U1 cells but not in ACH-2 cells .,,,
" Its 50 % effective and cytotoxic concentrations were 0.016 and 2.2 microg/ml in PMA-stimulated U1 cells , respectively .",,,
 Cepharanthine was found to suppress HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation .,,,
 These results indicate that cepharanthine is a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in a chronically infected monocytic cell line .,,,
" Since biscoclaurine alkaloids , containing cepharanthine as a major component , are widely used for the treatment of patients with various inflammatory diseases in Japan , cepharanthine should be further pursued for its chemotherapeutic potential in HIV-1-infected patients .",,,
 Prostaglandin E2 Up-regulates HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven gene activity in T cells via NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways .,,,
 Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is highly dependent on the state of activation of the infected cells and is modulated by interactions between viral and host cellular factors .,,,
" Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , a pleiotropic immunomodulatory molecule , is observed at elevated levels during HIV-1 infection as well as during the course of other pathogenic infections .",,,
" In 1G5 , a Jurkat-derived T cell line stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , we found that PGE2 markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR-mediated reporter gene activity .",,,
 Experiments have been conducted to identify second messengers involved in this PGE2-dependent up-regulating effect on the regulatory element of HIV-1 .,,,
" In this study , we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE2 necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP , protein kinase A , and Ca2+ .",,,
 Experiments conducted with different HIV-1 LTR-based vectors suggested that PGE2-mediated activation effect on HIV-1 transcription was transduced via both NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways .,,,
 The involvement of NF-kappaB in the PGE2-dependent activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was further confirmed using a kappaB-regulated luciferase encoding vector and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .,,,
" Results from Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses , as well as the use of a selective antagonist indicated that PGE2 modulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity in studied T lymphoid cells is transduced via the EP4 receptor subtype .",,,
 These results suggest that secretion of PGE2 by macrophages in response to infection or inflammatory activators could induce signaling events resulting in activation of proviral DNA present into T cells latently infected with HIV-1 .,,,
 Fcgamma receptor-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in monocytes is independent of Ras .,,,
" Receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules ( FcR ) present on leukocyte cell membranes mediate a large number of cellular responses that are very important in host defense , including phagocytosis , cell cytotoxicity , production and secretion of inflammatory mediators , and modulation of the immune response .",,,
" Cross-linking of FcR with immune complexes leads , first to activation of protein-tyrosine kinases .",,,
 The molecular events that follow and that transduce signals from these receptors to the nucleus are still poorly defined .,,,
 We have investigated the signal transduction pathway from Fc receptors that leads to gene activation and production of cytokines in monocytes .,,,
" Cross-linking of FcR , on the THP-1 monocytic cell line , by immune complexes resulted in both activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and interleukin 1 production .",,,
 These responses were completely blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors .,,,
" In contrast , expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1 , in these cells , did not have any effect on FcR-mediated nuclear factor activation , suggesting that the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway was not used by these receptors .",expression;,4;,Gene_expression;
" However , MAPK activation was easily detected by in vitro kinase assays , after FcR cross-linking with immune complexes .",,,
" Using the specific MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase ( MAPK kinase ) inhibitor PD98059 , we found that MAPK activation is necessary for FcR-dependent activation of the nuclear factor NF-kappaB .",,,
" These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from Fc receptors leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology , initiates with tyrosine kinases and requires MAPK activation ; but in contrast to other tyrosine kinase receptors , FcR-mediated MAPK activation does not involve Ras and Raf .",,,

 Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display ( DD ) .,,,
" Sequence analysis of DD products revealed two cDNAs with identity to known gene products : the catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase ( DNA-PK(CS) ) , and the peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV ( 17beta-HSD IV ) .",,,
 Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both mRNAs was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of VDR .,expression;reduced;,5;10;,Transcription;Negative_regulation;

" The chemokine receptor , BLR1 , is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of B cells in lymphoid organs .",,,

 Interaction of sickle erythrocytes with endothelial cells in the presence of endothelial cell conditioned medium induces oxidant stress leading to transendothelial migration of monocytes .,,,
" The abnormal adherence of sickle red blood cells ( SS RBC ) to endothelial cells has been thought to contribute to vascular occlusion , a major cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease ( SCD ) .",,,
 We determined whether the interaction of SS RBC with cultured endothelial cells induced cellular oxidant stress that would culminate in expression of cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) involved in the adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes and the adherence of SS reticulocytes .,,,
" We showed that the interaction of SS RBC at 2 % concentration in the presence of multimers of von Willebrand factor ( vWf ) , derived from endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium ( E-CM ) with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , resulted in a fivefold increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , both indicators of cellular oxidant stress .",multimers;,17;,Binding;
 Normal RBC show none of these phenomena .,,,
" The oxidant stress-induced signaling resulted in an increased surface expression of a subset of CAMs , ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 in HUVEC .",expression;,10;,Localization;

" Furthermore , SS RBC-induced oxidant stress resulted in a twofold increase in the transendothelial migration of both monocyte-like HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes , and approximately a sixfold increase in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) phosphorylation , each of which was blocked by protein kinase C inhibitor and antioxidants .",increase;increase;phosphorylation;blocked;,11;31;40;46;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;Negative_regulation;
" These results suggest that the adherence/contact of SS RBC to endothelial cells in large vessel can generate enhanced oxidant stress leading to increased adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes , as well as heightened adherence of SS reticulocytes , indicating that injury/activation of endothelium can contribute to vaso-occlusion in SCD .",,,

" We determined whether Hsp70 induction by TS was mediated by the activation of the HS transcription factor , HSF .",,,
 HSF activation has been shown to inhibit NFkappaB .,,,
" Thus , we also determined the effects of TS on NFkappaB .",,,

 Transcriptional regulation of the beta-casein gene by cytokines : cross-talk between STAT5 and other signaling molecules .,,,

 Cloning of ARE-containing genes by AU-motif-directed display .,,,
 A procedure suitable for cloning labile mRNAs that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU-DD ) .,,,
" These motifs are regulatory sequences within the so-called AU-rich elements ( AREs ) often found in 3' untranslated regions of genes such as cytokines , proto-oncogenes , and transcription factors .",,,
 AU-DD is an AU-motif-directed differential display that permits the identification of ARE-containing genes differentially expressed after cell activation .,,,
 It has been applied to peripheral blood monocytes and a T cell clone to isolate 59 cDNA fragments associated to activation .,,,
 Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are cytokines and transduction/transcription factors .,,,
 The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown genes of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed .,,,
 These data demonstrate the efficiency of the system and support the notion that numerous genes falling into those categories remain unidentified and that they can be cloned by this method .,,,

 Epithelial cell-initiated inflammation plays a crucial role in early tissue damage in amebic infection of human intestine .,,,
 BACKGROUND & AIMS : Entamoeba histolytica infection of the intestine can induce severe gut inflammation .,,,
 The aims of this study were to assess the role of the host inflammatory response in the tissue damage observed with amebiasis and the role of the intestinal epithelial cell in initiating that response .,,,
 METHODS : E. histolytica infection was established in human intestinal xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID-HU-INT ) mice .,,,
" Human intestinal epithelial cell inflammatory responses to amebic infection were inhibited by the intraluminal administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the human p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB , and the role of neutrophils in tissue damage observed with amebiasis was studied by depleting neutrophils from SCID-HU-INT mice .",,,
 RESULTS : Administration of the antisense oligonucleotide blocked the production of human interleukin 1beta and interleukin 8 by intestinal epithelial cells and inhibited neutrophil influx into the E. histolytica-infected intestinal xenografts .,blocked;production;,8;10;,Negative_regulation;Gene_expression;
 Inhibition of the gut inflammatory response by the antisense oligonucleotide or the depletion of neutrophils from SCID-HU- INT mice blocked the increase in intestinal permeability observed with amebic infection .,,,
 CONCLUSIONS : Intestinal epithelial cells initiate an inflammatory response with resulting neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in response to E. histolytica infection ; this inflammatory cascade can be blocked by inhibiting the transcription of genes regulated by nuclear factor kappaB .,,,
 In vitro suppression of programmed cell death of B cells by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 .,,,

" Furthermore , recombinant TIMP-1 , but not TIMP-2 or a synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor ( BB-94 ) , confers resistance to apoptosis induced by both CD95 - dependent and -independent ( cold shock , serum deprivation , and gamma-radiation ) pathways in TIMP-1 - negative BL lines .",,,
" TIMP-1 suppression of PCD is not due to metalloproteinase inhibition , as reduction and alkylation of the TIMP-1 did not abolish this activity .",reduction;,13;,Negative_regulation;
" Retroviral induction of TIMP-1 not only resulted in cell survival but also in continued DNA synthesis for up to 5 d in the absence of serum , while controls underwent apoptosis .",induction;,2;,Positive_regulation;

 Anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a induce nuclear factor kappaB activation in human peripheral blood monocytes .,,,
 The anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a are involved in the regulation of cytokine production .,,,
 In this study the capability of C5a and C3a to induce transcription factor activation was examined .,,,
 C5a and C3a stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes resulted in nuclear expression of a DNA binding activity with specificity to the kappaB sequence .,,,
" The p50 and p65 proteins , constituents of the prototypic nuclear factor kappaB , were identified as components of the DNA-protein complexes by anti-peptide antibodies in gel supershift assays .",,,
" C5a induced kappaB binding activity was detected 15 min after agonist stimulation , peaked at 30-40 min , and remained detectable at 2 h .",,,
" Binding to kappaB sequence was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in the cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha levels , as detected by Western blotting using an anti - IkappaBalpha antibody .",decrease;increase;,10;13;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Pertussis toxin treatment markedly decreased kappaB binding activities induced by both C5a and C3a , whereas cholera toxin displayed no inhibitory effect .",,,
 Neither of the two toxins affected kappaB binding activity induced by TNFalpha in the same cells .,,,
 These results imply a potential role of the anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a in regulating leukocytes gene expression through G protein-coupled transcription factor activation .,,,
 Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF-kappaB .,induces;expression;,2;4;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) or the calcineurin/NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways .,activation;inhibited;promoted;,6;14;34;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" We , therefore , conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 .",activation;,25;,Positive_regulation;

" While the activation of the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFAT delta418 , it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl-2 - mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways .",activation;blocked;blocked;activation;,3;17;30;44;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;

 Activation of human macrophages by mechanical ventilation in vitro .,,,
 Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation supports gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure but is also responsible for significant lung injury .,,,
" In this study , we have developed an in vitro model in which isolated lung cells can be submitted to a prolonged cyclic pressure-stretching strain resembling that of conventional mechanical ventilation .",,,
" In this model , cells cultured on a Silastic membrane were elongated up to 7 % of their initial diameter , corresponding to a 12 % increase in cell surface .",,,
" The lung macrophage was identified as the main cellular source for critical inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , the chemokines interleukin ( IL ) -8 and -6 , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in this model system of mechanical ventilation .",source;,10;,Gene_expression;
" These mediators were measured in supernatants from ventilated alveolar macrophages , monocyte-derived macrophages , and promonocytic THP-1 cells .",,,
 Nuclear factor-kappaB was found to be activated in ventilated macrophages .,,,
" Synergistic proinflammatory effects of mechanical stress and molecules such as bacterial endotoxin were observed , suggesting that mechanical ventilation might be particularly deleterious in preinjured or infected lungs .",,,

 Interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta promoter polymorphisms in allergies and asthma .,,,
" Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) are inhibitory for B and T cells , IgE production , and mast cell proliferation , and they induce apoptosis in eosinophils .",,,
 These cytokines are therefore candidate genes which could contribute to the development of asthma or allergies .,,,
 We investigated the hypothesis that polymorphic nucleotides within the IL-10 and TGF-beta gene promoters would link to the expression of allergies and asthma .,,,
 DNA taken from families with an asthmatic proband was examined for base exchanges by single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) .,,,
 We demonstrated the presence of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene and four in the TGF-beta gene promoters ( 3 in TGF-beta1 and 1 in TGF-beta2 ) .,,,
 The IL-10 gene polymorphism was a C-to-A exchange 571 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and was present between consensus binding sequences for Sp1 and elevated total serum .,,,
 This polymorphism was associated with elevated total serum IgE in subjects heterozygotic or homozygotic for this base exchange ( p < 0.009 ) .,,,
 The base exchange at -509 ( from the transcription initiation site ) in the TGF-beta promoter also linked to elevated total IgE ( p < 0.01 ) .,,,
 This polymorphism represented a C-to-T base exchange which induced a YY1 consensus sequence and is present in a region of the promoter associated with negative transcription regulation .,,,
 The control of lytic replication of Epstein-Barr virus in B lymphocytes ( Review ) .,,,
" Uncontrolled replication of a virus , which is harmful to the host is also disadvantageous to the virus .",,,
 Most viruses can not compete with the various immune mechanisms and become eliminated in the course of infection .,,,
" Therefore , only the time between infection and eradication remains for these viruses to proliferate .",,,
" A few viruses , like the Herpesviruses or the papillomaviruses , however , have developed a sophisticated strategy for persisting lifelong , usually asymptomatically in the host , hiding from the immune system and producing infectious progeny at the same time .",,,
" This strategy depends on a separation of latency and the lytic replication , either by time due to differentiation-dependent mechanisms or by spatial separation as the result of different host cell types .",,,
 Both are true for the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .,,,
 B cells and epithelial cells have a pivotal role in the life cycle of the virus .,,,
" The former can become latently infected and are thought to be the virus reservoir in vivo , whereas the latter were shown to be permissive for lytic replication .",,,
" However , replication of EBV in vivo is controlled primarily by host immune mechanisms selecting for cells that are not permissive for viral replication as the result of a particular set of transcription factors .",,,
" These factors control the activity of the regulatory immediate-early genes and , in addition , lytic and latent cycle regulatory genes negatively interfere with each other and thus link cellular and viral gene regulatory mechanisms .",,,
 Disturbance of both the immune surveillance as well as viral gene regulation may result in EBV-associated disease .,,,
 Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 transcription : role of the 5'-untranslated leader region ( review ) .,,,
 Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription is dependent on the interaction of host-cell transcription factors with cis-regulatory DNA elements within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .,,,
 Much attention has focused on the series of sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional initiation site in the U3 region of the LTR including the Sp1 and NF-kappaB binding sites .,,,
" Recent studies , however , demonstrate that the transcribed 5'-untranslated leader region ( 5'-UTR ) also contains important transcriptional elements .",,,
" These regulatory elements situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and inducible transcription factors , mediate transmission of cellular activation signals , and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication .",,,
" The 5'-UTR contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappaB , NF-AT , IRF , and Sp1 .",,,
" Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals , decrease LTR transcription , and inhibit viral replication .",,,
 The 5'-UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus .,,,
" We propose that the inducible transcription factor binding sites in the 5'-UTR comprise a downstream enhancer domain that can function independent of , or in concert with , the LTR promoter to rapidly increase latent proviral transcription in response to cell activation signals .",,,
" In this review , we describe the host-cell transcription factors that interact with the 5'-UTR and discuss their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression .",,,
" Molecular cloning of FKHRL1P2 , a member of the developmentally regulated fork head domain transcription factor family .",,,
 Here we report the expression of a fork head domain protein in human T helper cells .,,,
 We cloned and characterized a fork head cDNA from human T helper cell mRNA using differential display RT-PCR .,,,
 The cDNA contains a 546-nucleotide ( nt ) open reading frame ( ORF ) that codes for the carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids ( aa ) of the recently identified fkhrl1 gene .,,,
 This ORF does not contain the characteristic DNA-binding domain found in members of the forkhead protein family .,,,
 In-vitro transcription/translation of this cDNA expressed a protein of approximately 20 kDa .,,,
 We have generated antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated the in-vitro-translated 20-kDa protein .,,,
 This antibody also recognizes in human T lymphocytes a 70-kDa protein corresponding in size to that predicted for the fkhrl1 gene product .,recognizes;product;,4;22;,Binding;Gene_expression;

 Interactions between the class II transactivator and CREB binding protein increase transcription of major histocompatibility complex class II genes .,Interactions;,1;,Binding;
 Class II major histocompatibility ( class II ) genes are regulated in a B-cell-specific and gamma interferon - inducible fashion .,,,

 Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between CIITA and CBP were demonstrated .,,,
" Moreover , a dominant negative form of CBP decreased the activity of class II promoters and levels of class II determinants on the surface of cells .",,,

 Phenylarsine oxide inhibits ex vivo HIV-1 expression .,,,
" Phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , which is described as an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity , inhibits H2O2 release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) as measured by electrochemistry .",,,
" Since human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is known to be favored under oxidative stress conditions , ex vivo experiments using uninfected PBMCs , primary monocytes or a latently infected promonocytic U1 cell line show that HIV-1 replication and reactivation , monitored by p24 antigen measurement , are inhibited by PAO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner .",,,
 These observations can be linked with the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation when uninfected monocytes are induced by either tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .,,,

 X-rays-induced secretion of cellular factor(s) that enhance(s) HIV-1 promoter transcription in various non-irradiated transfected cell lines .,,,
 Various cellular stress agents like ionizing radiation exposure could activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV- 1 ) replication or reporter gene expression .,,,
" In addition , extracellular factor(s) released by X-ray-treated human colonic carcinoma cell line ( HT29 ) might activate the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 in non-irradiated HT29 cells .",,,

" Here we show that deregulated expression of a single viral gene , ORF 50 , which encodes a transactivator able to selectively upregulate delayed-early viral genes , suffices to disrupt latency and induce the lytic gene cascade in latently infected B cells .",deregulated;expression;,5;6;,Regulation;Gene_expression;

 Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein abrogates interleukin-2 dependence in a mouse T-cell line .,,,
 Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia .,,,
" Tax , the viral protein , is thought to be crucial in the development of the disease , since it transforms healthy T cells in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals .",,,
 We examined the effect of Tax activity on the growth of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent T-cell line CTLL-2 .,,,
 Stable expression of Tax in CTLL-2 transformed cell growth from being IL-2 dependent to IL-2 independent .,expression;,2;,Gene_expression;
 Tax stimulated transcription through NF-kappaB and the cyclic AMP-responsive element-like sequence in the HTLV-1 promoter .,,,
 The finding of Tax mutants segregating these two pathways suggested that the NF-kappaB pathway was essential for IL-2 - independent growth of CTLL-2 cells while the CRE pathway was unnecessary .,,,
" However , both pathways were necessary for another transformation-related activity ( colony formation in soft agar ) of CTLL-2 / Tax .",,,
" Our results show that Tax has at least two distinct activities on T cells , and suggest that Tax plays a crucial role in IL-2 - independent T-cell transformation induced by HTLV-1 , in addition to its well-known IL-2 - dependent cell transformation .",,,
 Regulation of IL-6 synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by C3a and C3a(desArg) .,Regulation;synthesis;,1;4;,Regulation;Gene_expression;
 The anaphylatoxin C3a has been reported to have immunomodulatory effects on a number of different cell types .,,,

 Northern blot analysis showed that C3a as well as C3a(desArg) enhanced LPS - induced mRNA levels for IL-6 .,enhanced;induced;,11;14;,Positive_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Pretreatment of PBMCs with pertussis toxin blocked the functions of C3a and C3a(desArg) , indicating that the actions of these two molecules are mediated by a G protein-coupled pathway .",blocked;mediated;,7;24;,Negative_regulation;Positive_regulation;
" Furthermore , we investigated the effects of C3a and C3a(desArg) on induction of NF-kappaB and activating protein-1 binding .",,,
 Both molecules enhanced LPS-induced NF-kappaB and activating protein-1 binding activity .,,,
 These results demonstrate the capacity of intact C3a and its circulating des-Arg form to exert immunmodulatory effects in vitro .,,,
 Differential monocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in venous and arterial endothelial cells .,,,
" We compared U-937 cell adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical venous ( HUVECs ) and arterial ( HUAECs ) endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin-1 , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .",,,
 TNF and LPS stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 surface expression and adhesion of U-937 monocyte-like cells to HUVECs but not to HUAECs .,stimulated;expression;,4;14;,Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;

 Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked TNF- and LPS-stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to HUVECs .,,,

 TNF increased VCAM-1 protein and mRNA in HUVECs that was blocked by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate .,increased;blocked;,2;11;,Positive_regulation;Negative_regulation;

 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated no difference in the pattern of TNF-stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB activation between HUVECs and HUAECs .,,,
 These studies demonstrate a novel and striking insensitivity of arterial endothelium to the effects of TNF and LPS and indicate a dissociation between the ability of HUAECs to upregulate nuclear factor-kappaB and VCAM-1 .,upregulate;,29;,Positive_regulation;

 LysoPC inhibited the TF activity of Mono Mac-6 cells to a similar extent as in the monocytes .,inhibited;,2;,Negative_regulation;
 LPS binding to plasma membrane receptors and internalization of LPS into monocytes were not affected by lysoPC .,,,
" In contrast , LPS-mediated nuclear binding of nuclear factor-kappaB/Rel to a TF - specific kappaB site was inhibited by lysoPC .",,,
 Induction of TF mRNA expression by LPS tended to be partially reduced by the lysophospholipid .,Induction;expression;reduced;,1;5;12;,Positive_regulation;Transcription;Negative_regulation;

 Intranuclear targeted delivery of functional NF-kappaB by 70 kDa heat shock protein .,,,
" The 70 kDa heat shock protein ( Hsp70 ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitous protein involved in chaperoning proteins to various cellular organelles .",,,
" Here we show that when added exogenously to cells , Hsp70 is readily imported into both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in a cell-type-specific fashion .",,,
" We exploited this ability of Hsp70 to deliver NF-kappaB , a key transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses .",,,
" We demonstrate that a fusion protein composed of a C-terminal Hsp70 peptide and the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB was directed into the nucleus of cells , could bind DNA specifically , and activated Igkappa expression and TNFalpha production .",directed;bind;activated;expression;production;,20;28;33;35;38;,Localization;Binding;Positive_regulation;Gene_expression;Gene_expression;
 We therefore propose that Hsp70 can be used as a vehicle for intracytoplasmic and intranuclear delivery of proteins or DNA to modulate gene expression and thereby control immune responses .,,,
 CD2 signalling induces phosphorylation of CREB in primary lymphocytes .,induces;phosphorylation;,3;4;,Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;
" Promoter sequences responsive to cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) are found in a number of cellular genes , and bind transcription factors of the cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) / activating transcription factor-1 ( ATF-1 ) family .",,,
 We have used a human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) model of cAMP response element ( CRE ) transcription to investigate the influence of lymphocyte activation on transcription from homologous regions in the viral promoter .,,,
 We previously demonstrated increased HTLV-1 transcription following CD2 but not CD3 receptor cross-linking .,cross-linking;,13;,Binding;
" We hypothesized that this increased viral transcription was mediated , in part , through the phosphorylation of CREB .",phosphorylation;,16;,Phosphorylation;
" Therefore , we investigated CD2 and CD3 receptor-mediated signalling in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .",,,
" CD2 , but not CD3 , cross-linking increased cAMP detected by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) approximately fourfold .",cross-linking;,7;,Binding;
 CD2 cross-linking concurrently increased phosphorylation of CREB detected by immunoblot assay eightfold .,cross-linking;increased;phosphorylation;,2;4;5;,Binding;Positive_regulation;Phosphorylation;
" Consistent with post-translational regulation , no change in total level of CREB protein was observed .",,,

 Anoxia/reoxygenation-induced tolerance with respect to polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion to cultured endothelial cells .,,,
 A nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated phenomenon .,,,
 Exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) to anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) results in an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) adhesion to HUVECs .,,,
 This A/R-induced hyperadhesion is completely prevented by a previous ( 24 hours earlier ) exposure of HUVECs to A/R .,,,
" This phenomenon has been termed "" A/R tolerance. "" Exposing HUVECs to A/R induces an increase in nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) in HUVEC nuclei within 4 hours .",,,
" Interfering with either NF-kappaB activation ( proteasome inhibitor ) or translocation ( double-stranded oligonucleotides containing NF-kappaB binding sequence ) prevents the development of A/R tolerance ( ie , the increase in A/R-induced PMN adhesion to HUVECs is the same after the first and second A/R challenges ) .",,,
" NO production by HUVECs is increased after the second A/R challenge , but not after the first A/R challenge .",,,
 Inhibition of NO synthase ( NOS ) during the second A/R challenge prevents the development of A/R tolerance with respect to PMN adhesion .,Inhibition;,1;,Negative_regulation;
" However , while HUVECs contained endothelial NOS protein , no inducible NOS was detected in either tolerant or nontolerant cells .",contained;inducible;,5;11;,Gene_expression;Positive_regulation;
" Further studies indicated that inhibition of GTP-cyclohydrolase I ( an enzyme involved in de novo synthesis of an important cofactor for NOS activity , tetrahydrobiopterin ) prevented the generation of NO in A/R-tolerant cells .",inhibition;,5;,Negative_regulation;
 Extracellular generation of NO ( NO donor ) did not effect the hyperadhesion response induced by the initial A/R challenge .,,,
" A/R also induced an oxidant stress in naive HUVECs , but not in A/R-tolerant HUVECs .",,,
 Inhibition of NOS during the second A/R insult results in the generation of an oxidant stress similar to that observed after the first A/R challenge .,Inhibition;,1;,Negative_regulation;
" Taken together , the findings of the present study are consistent with a role for NF-kappaB in the development of A/R tolerance ( with respect to PMN adhesion ) , perhaps by transcriptional regulation of GTP-cyclohydrolase .",,,
 The increased NO production during the second A/R insult reduces PMN adhesion most likely by reducing the intracellular oxidant stress induced by A/R .,,,

 Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in vitro and in vivo : role of 26S proteasome .,,,
 It is becoming increasingly apparent that NF-kappa B plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response .,,,
 Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the proteasome plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade by regulating the activation of NF-kappa B .,,,
" Indeed , the availability of selective and orally active proteasome inhibitors should prove useful in delineating the roles of the proteasome and NF-kappa B in other pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and heart disease .",,,
 NF-kappaB activation is a critical regulator of human granulocyte apoptosis in vitro .,,,
" During beneficial inflammation , potentially tissue-damaging granulocytes undergo apoptosis before being cleared by phagocytes in a non-phlogistic manner .",,,
" Here we show that the rate of constitutive apoptosis in human neutrophils and eosinophils is greatly accelerated in both a rapid and concentration-dependent manner by the fungal metabolite gliotoxin , but not by its inactive analog methylthiogliotoxin .",,,
" This induction of apoptosis was abolished by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk , correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) , and was mimicked by a cell permeable inhibitory peptide of NF-kappaB , SN-50 ; other NF-kappaB inhibitors , curcumin and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ; and the proteasome inhibitor , MG-132 .",,,
 Gliotoxin also augmented dramatically the early ( 2-6 h ) pro-apoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in neutrophils and unmasked the ability of TNF-alpha to induce eosinophil apoptosis .,,,
" In neutrophils , TNF-alpha caused a gliotoxin-inhibitable activation of an inducible form of NF-kappaB , a response that may underlie the ability of TNF-alpha to delay apoptosis at later times ( 12-24 h ) and limit its early killing effect .",,,
" Furthermore , cycloheximide displayed a similar capacity to enhance TNF-alpha induced neutrophil apoptosis even at time points when cycloheximide alone had no pro-apoptotic effect , suggesting that NF-kappaB may regulate the production of protein(s) which protect neutrophils from the cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha .",,,
" These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte apoptosis and , in particular , indicate that the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological cell death pathway in granulocytes .",,,

" Activation of the LTR in Jurkat cells was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by catalase , implicating H2O2 .",,,
" In contrast , activation in THP-1 cells occurred in the absence of vanadate and was unaffected by catalase .",,,

 High-level replication of human immunodeficiency virus in thymocytes requires NF-kappaB activation through interaction with thymic epithelial cells .,,,
" We have previously demonstrated that interaction of infected thymocytes with autologous thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) is a prerequisite for a high level of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in thymocytes ( M.Rothe , L.Chene , M.Nugeyre , F.Barre-Sinoussi , and N.Israel , J.Virol.72:5852-5861 , 1998 ) .",,,
 We report here that this activation of HIV replication takes place at the transcriptional level through activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors .,,,
" We first demonstrate that an HIV-1 provirus ( SF-2 strain ) very effectively replicates in thymocytes cocultured with TEC whereas this provirus , with kappaB sites deleted , fails to replicate .",,,
 We provide evidence that several NF-kappaB complexes are constitutively found in the nuclei of thymocytes either freshly isolated from the thymus or maintained in coculture with autologous or heterologous TEC .,,,
 The prevalent complex is the heterodimer p50 - p65 .,,,
 NF-kappaB activity is tightly correlated with the transcriptional activity of a long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 transfected in thymocytes .,,,
 The cotransfection of this LTR with a mutated IkappaBalpha molecule formally demonstrates that LTR transactivation is regulated by members of the Rel/NF-kappaB family in thymocytes .,cotransfection;,2;,Gene_expression;
" We also showed that tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and to a lesser extent interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , secreted within the coculture , induce NF-kappaB activity and a correlative LTR transactivation .",,,

 Oleic acid inhibits endothelial activation : A direct vascular antiatherogenic mechanism of a nutritional component in the mediterranean diet .,,,

" We incubated sodium oleate with human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 0 to 72 hours , followed by coincubation of oleate with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor , interleukin ( IL ) -1alpha , IL-1beta , IL-4 , Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for a further 6 to 24 hours .",,,
" The endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , E-selectin , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was monitored by cell surface enzyme immunoassays or flow cytometry , and steady-state levels of VCAM-1 mRNA were assessed by Northern blot analysis .",expression;levels;,3;32;,Gene_expression;Transcription;

 Incubation of endothelial cells with oleate for 72 hours decreased the relative proportions of saturated ( palmitic and stearic ) acids in total cell lipids and increased the proportions of oleate in total cell lipids without significantly changing the relative proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids .,,,
" Although less potent than polyunsaturated fatty acids in inhibiting endothelial activation , oleic acid may contribute to the prevention of atherogenesis through selective displacement of saturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids and a consequent modulation of gene expression for molecules involved in monocyte recruitment .",,,
